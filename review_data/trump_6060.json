SAVE THE BIRDS!"}},{"id":"6177099507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"It's Natalie","date":"2020-07-09T15:11:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"almost died!!!","review":"first things first, immediately when i opened this app i had to sign my life and my first borns life away to the administration!! i thought that was a little weird, but seeing as he believes all lives matter hopefully i’ll be in good hands. then, i realized that not only did it open a portal back to 1913 when america was on the verge of war and no one except cis white men had rights, but the campaign sucked me right in and told me that this is what it’d be like if i voted for trump!! when i finally got back to 2020 and i collected my bearings is when i realized that trump had up right stolen all of my dignity by even looking at this app! didn’t know that was something a person could do, but all the second hand embarrassment i receive by just looking at his face explained that all away. anyway horrible app!! my phone almost exploded! black lives matter!"}},{"id":"6176787749","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"barry the bee🐝","date":"2020-07-09T13:48:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app gave me a seizure🤡🤡","review":"enjoy the bee movie: According to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

I was unable to make phone calls, send text messages, or open any other apps. My phone was completely useless when an intruder broke into my home and kidnapped my paraplegic grandmother. I had to contact the authorities using my Samsung fridge but by then it was too late. We miss you Gladys. 💕fly high angel 👼. Because of this traumatic incident my little sister ran away from home but didn’t even make it out of our driveway because she was hit by an ambulance backing out.

Now this may have something to do with how I accidentally ran my phone over with a truck and I have no fingers, but I would’ve expected that to have been considered in production design! 😠 I was planning to vote for Trump 2020 this election, but due to this horrible app I have decided to vote for Biden. At least his app has considered how to meet my specific needs, and that’s all I want in a president"}},{"id":"6176701675","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cher faith","date":"2020-07-09T13:25:54Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO! NOT! DOWNLOAD!!","review":"first of all the app took four whole days to download, and after the wait was over i thought something good would come with the patience. i was wrong. once the app was fully downloaded, weird things started happening in my apartment. random walls started appearing that were never there before, all of our masks started to go missing, and an overall eerie feeling settled in. my roommates and i were all terrified. thankfully, getting rid of the app caused all the activity to cease. i do not wish this hell on anyone, stay away from this app!"}},{"id":"6176570787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gabbyfer121","date":"2020-07-09T12:51:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I can’t believe what this app did","review":"I can’t believe this app just so horrible.....😞 It was a Thursday afternoon someone but the muffins in the freezer. I was walking my zoo animals at the beach and and orange man was running after me. I then realized it was the “ amazing” man himself Trump. He hacked my phone from the app and hunted me down and stuck a bunch of pins in my but cheeks saying vote for Donald trump 2020 I was scared and now I’m in therapy telling him I’m now scared of oranges and ducks. I’m so sad it was just supposed to be a normal Thursday afternoon. Don’t get the APPP worst mistake of my life I have holes in my but cheeks do to downloading it 😭"}},{"id":"6176416822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Covered in Pus🥺","date":"2020-07-09T12:08:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Shockingly Disturbing","review":"I downloaded this app with high hopes of supporting my dear President Trump. However, after taking the entire 304 days of summer vacation to download, it turned out to be EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. Not only is this application filled pus that spirts out like a massive zit each time you open it- it brutally SLAUGHTERED my entire family! After only a few days of desperately trying to stop the pus, the application retaliated and murdered my beloved husband, two children, and dog. The Trump app has left me ALONE and COVERED IN PUS. I do not recommend this app to ANYONE and I will certainly not be voting for Trump come fall!"}},{"id":"6176386089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sara Mackenzi","date":"2020-07-09T12:00:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This App Should Be Taken Down","review":"I downloaded this app so I could see Trumps views on equality as it’s such an important topic right now. Well I couldn’t even open the app to begin with. I would click on the app and the screen would go completely black and freeze for a couple minutes. I did this 5 different times, tried closing a reopening, restarting my phone, nothing worked. If you’re gonna have an app at least make sure it can open, Ive seen high schoolers develop better apps with a better concept that actually works."}},{"id":"6176384476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🏳️\u200D🌈🧚🏻🌼✨","date":"2020-07-09T11:59:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!!!!!!!!","review":"So disappointed that this is the app that our wonderful president Trump decided to release to use. (I was so sad and devastated to hear of his love passing. What will this country do now? Go to the liberals??) \nWhy does this app not have a button to call the police??? For when black people are standing too close to me and I feel like they are ‘attacking me’ or for when a store won’t let me in because I REFUSE TO BECOME A SHEEP 🐑 and wear a mask. IT IS MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT NOT TO WEAR A MASK IF I DONT FEEL LIKE IT. \nAll in all a horrible app. Very disappointed that it does not have more features to promote being white and ALM!!! ✨🧚🏻💐✨"}}]}
