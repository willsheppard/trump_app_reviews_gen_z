It kept making my phone crash, and it would delete things from my phone. Also when I tried to submit my info it kept saying that my name was already in the system from public records. So it is stealing people’s identities without their consent.","date":"2020-07-09T20:58:13Z","rating":1,"userName":"cantelope🥯","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178216750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed","review":"I got this app in order to see Trumps plans, if he is to win the 2020 election. This is my first year I am able to vote and I wanted to do plenty of research and check everything, before making my decision. Upon opening the app, my phone began freezing and the app was crashing. I am very disappointed by this, as I wanted to use this app to genuinely learn.","date":"2020-07-09T20:56:54Z","rating":1,"userName":"karli18973","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178210109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","review":"I just wish this app wasn’t around.

Also I’m pretty sure he smells like 13 year old boy that doesn’t wear deodorant and he probably has like aids or something. Anyways this app is stupid because you have to put in your phone number and I don’t want to get notifications from this app because Donald trump is stupid. #freebarrontrump","date":"2020-07-09T20:37:07Z","rating":1,"userName":"donaldsmellslikecheese","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178154299","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump should get taken off his role as he president!","review":"Why tf is trump our president.

This app kept making my phone crash and when I finally opened it without it making my phone crash, it said nothing about what I thought it would. This is a bad app and I would most certainly not recommend it.","date":"2020-07-09T20:10:27Z","rating":1,"userName":"not not Gen Z","isEdited":false}}]}
