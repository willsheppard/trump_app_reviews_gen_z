As a mindless conservative drone, it seemed like the perfect fit for me. The mind-numbingly dull color scheme didn’t distract me from the letters on the screen, which is a big plus. However, last night I was using the app, just scrolling, and I got 3 error messages saying my phone was being dredged for data. Okay, that was weird, but later that night, my phone began emitting a high pitches screech. I looked at it, and the trump app was opened on its own, making this horrible sound. Even that was excusable until the the secret service busted through my door and arrested me because the data they took from my phone showed that I am not in fact a conservator, but a leftist 😸😸😊😸😸 and then I was kicked for hours by the secret service and then by trump himself. So yeah, it’s a pretty bad, not-secure , spying app."}},{"id":"6173168374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Left wing terriosts 😡🍊🍑","userName":"hazasahay","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:54:25Z","review":"OMG I downloaded this app because I believe in trump 2020 and overall because I believe woman should not have rights, but it took 4 HOURS to download. Meanwhile I couldn’t do anything else and I was out of the house so my phone died. I highly recommend you save yourself the time and hassle and don’t download this app. When the app FINALLY downloaded it kept glitching and crashing. I don’t know if it was because too many people were on there or because maybe miss internet just doesn’t like fascists...but the facts(since we are supposedly a party of facts lol) are that every time I would click on a button on the app it would take forever to load and eventually glitch out. I REGRET downloading the app because even though I have since deleted it I know am still getting adds for oranges, peaches,\nbunker construction companies, and spray tan?!? If anyone else is experiencing this issue and knows how to fix it let me know. I really just wanted to download this app so I could have a platform in which to peacefully spread hate but I guess not. HUUUGE disappointment. \n\nTo cheer up I’m going to go drive my car into a peaceful protest 😺. \n\nXoxo, KKKlansmen Jerry\n\nDegree in racism, fascism, xenophobia, sexism.."}},{"id":"6173157018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"⛓⛓⛓BERNIE🥵🥵🥵","userName":"El Noah Noah","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:50:49Z","review":"To fully grasp the quantum mechanics found intertwining in the cosmos, one comes to find the hollywood sex ring. Celebrities take adrenachrome to make them appear younger, keep in mind adrenachrome is extracted from children. 800 thousand children go missing every year, I wonder why.  E mails were found from the elite exposing them and having nicknames for children as “pizza” However the app thought me that everything i see is just “fake news” A FABU👮 cheeto puff 🖐🏻✌🏻🖐🏻🚓 is all there is in life and nothing more. President trump will keep all the dirty, rapists, Mexicans out of our country. Yes I want the economy to lose 1 trillion 💰 and for 8 million Americans to be unemployed. Even though it seems much simpler to just make it easier for immigrants to become legal since this would benefit everyone. But no I trust trump to keep all the whites on top, and minorities on the bottom."}},{"id":"6172989537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No❤️","userName":"person825725282","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:58:05Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see everything that was happening with our president only for this app to cause my phone problems. My phone began glitching and I kept seeing orange all over my screen. Honestly it was terrible. Affecting my phone wasn’t the only thing it affected. It even affected me personally. I was so scared when I kept seeing this creepy old man, and it got so bad I started seeing him in my dreams! Donald Trump absolutely scared me, and I don’t think I’ll ever be the same. I don’t know when the nightmares will stop of Trump winning the election of 2020. The world ends in those dreams and I don’t think I could handle it anymore. I feel as though the whole app should be deleted so therefore I can sleep peacefully again. Please and thank you. My advice DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP🧚\u200D♀️✨\n                           Sincerely, \n     A person stuck with nightmares😢"}},{"id":"6172889698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"slowed down my entire phone","userName":"👁✨👄✨👁💧","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:27:04Z","review":"this app is atrocious. my very new iphone 12 pro was quite literally broken while this app was downloaded on my phone. first of all it took over 20 MINUTES to download, and then it took me even longer to reach the first screen without it crashing? by the time i could interact with the app’s options i was fed up and closed the app. i don’t delete it just yet, bc i was going to try again in case it was my phones fault, right. wrong. my phone ‘s internet started slowing down and everything was lagging. i was dropping phone calls and was having trouble even with my messages. i was reading through these reviews and eventually deleted the app AND THEN EVERYTHING TURNED BACK TO NORMAL. i agree 110% with my fellow 1-starers , and i speak for everyone when i say i wish i could give it a lower score."}},{"id":"6172820247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BLM ✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 and orange cheeto president is a racist🧚\u200D♀️🧚🧚\u200D♂️✨✨","userName":"grace🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️✌🏻😎✨✨✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:06:23Z","review":"this app made me have a very severe seizure and caused me to go to the hospital 5 times✌🏻😔 then when i went to go back home i realized i left the app open on my phone in my room and when i came back i saw my cat😿😿and she looked at my phone and died ☠️☠️☠️😭😭😭😭all thanks to this app😔😔☠️☠️i would not recommend getting this app it causes lots of deathly seizures and the only people that like this app are old white racist men👨🏻\u200D🦳👨🏻\u200D🦳👨🏻\u200D🦳👨🏻\u200D🦳also if you think all lives matter die🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️💞💞 because all lives dont matter until black lives do because they are being killed for their skin color and our orange cheeto president doesnt think so✌🏻😔✨✨☠️☠️overall i would give this app a -infinity/10 and if i could on the app store i would give it 0 stars ✌🏻😎✨✨✨✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿dont forget Black Lives Matter"}},{"id":"6172796547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Fake News","userName":"officialsoap","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:59:36Z","review":"Evidence proves that US president “Donald Trump” is in fact nothing but a government programmed droid. The government intentionally built this model using a reverse-psychology type design to incorporate features so “flawed” that they must be human traits. To date, this tactic has worked incredibly well at convincing the public he is a fellow human being. Take, for example, the splotchy carrot-orange paint job, slanted “walk” design, artificial hair, and repetitive hand motions. Furthermore, the model constantly needs refueling and updating, requiring the mechanics to “secretly” continue work in the bunker. Unfortunately, technology is still not advanced enough to enable the machine to carry out advanced thought-processing. How else can one explain the elementary-level of speech, thought, and overall complexity of the “president”? Surely no fully-grown human adult can be that dull and deprived of rational intelligence."}},{"id":"6172745958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"almost lost my life","userName":"gjbfbhucv. bhjb g","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:45:08Z","review":"As we all know trump doesn’t believe in universal health care but when I opened this app I was immediately blinded by trumps microscopic shrimpy penis 🐌🕺🏽 he literally started yelling at me “REMEMBER THE TIMES WE HAD THE TIMES ME AND YOU HAD” and I was immediately deafened and his breath was so bad I lost my smell 🧚🏻😕🤕 a cockroach also jumped through the screen and kisses me and now I have corona like what the hell trump I thought all lives matter yet you can’t even pay my medical bills 👹😍💘 maybe if trump was a human and not a shrimpy orange insecure cracker I would of been have my stimulus check by now to pay for my bills .. also even after the app was deleted from my phone I was suffocated at the hospital by nick videos that trump summoned thank god nikkita dragon and Charlie damelio saved me 👻🦋🤭 ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆"}},{"id":"6172563013","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Made my dog hysterical","userName":"coolpoodle12345678","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:53:46Z","review":"I downloaded this app to praise trump nued like any TRUE maga fan. As soon as I opened the app the poodle started slowly turning a deep orange. Of course I had already died her orange to represent our god but this was different it was like she dipped eight times in tanning solution then put 2 miles from the sun. She then started profusely pooping maga hats. I stacked as many as I could on my head but they just kept coming. I thought I could give some to my friends but I have none and I have already sacrificed my wife. I then anonymously sent some to my family (because of the restraining order.) my dog has bitten me and I would’ve survived if I wasn’t anti vaccination. I am now writing this from hell where I constantly stub my toe and our flip phones are (literally) glued to our faces. I think my poodle is going to heaven because she killed a trump supporter."}},{"id":"6172398521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disappointed","userName":"your bestie kim","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:08:32Z","review":"i wanted to download this app because i obviously wanted to support the cheeto king ofc. however when i downloaded it shane dawson  came in my room throwing all of my things and he even kept on singing a song and it went like “r-r-r-roll up to the party with my crazy pink wig but i can’t get through the door because my booty’s too big” and more and that was really strange. then he threw my bed out of the window. keep in mind he was farting the whole time so he made my room smell really bad:( i thought it couldn’t get any worse until nicky from the show nicky,ricky, dicky, and dawn came in my room and started screaming “lauv,lauv,lauv,by lauv” and my ears started bleeding. THEN gabbie hanna came into my room singing “WhaT iF I’m tHe MonStEr” and i was really scared. i eventually threw a fridge at them and threw them out of the window but that was a scary experience."}}]}
