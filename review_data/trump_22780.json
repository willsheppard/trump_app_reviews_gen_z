I downloaded the app because I was bored, but when it opened up it showed me a horrible image of a Cheeto. It was traumatic. I’m going to have nightmares for a long time. The app itself was glitchy. It gave false information about Trump. I was very uncomfortable.

It took 3 months to download, and when it finally did it crashed! I do not recommend unless you want to put yourself at risk because it steals your information and sells it on the web.

Don’t get it it’s awful!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6176658611","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:14:32Z","userName":"Chris Peacock 978","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"This is the worst app I have ever downloaded.

I was just trying to support the president, but when I downloaded it, my phone started glitching. It keeps closing out of other apps and it won’t let me google anything related to Black Lives Matter or women’s rights.
