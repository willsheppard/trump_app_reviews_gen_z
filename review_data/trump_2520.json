I lost my phone because of it!!!","review":"I got this app in hopes that I could learn about this amazing US president only to find out that it was a virus and DESTROYED my phone! It only first started out with taking up 17 gigabytes of storage but I was fine with that as long as I could still learn about trump. But then my phone started to come alive and make my house turn evil on me. After an hour I was terrified to realize that all my little brothers stuffed animals were possessed and had burnt my house down! I then ran away as far as I could but they chased me down... I got away from them and tried to delete the app but it wouldn’t let me... i threw my phone into a river and just ran for miles. I am safe and am typing this review on my friends phone.","date":"2020-07-09T05:57:03Z","userName":"The guy in the right corner","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175296727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app will burn down ur house and steal ur shoes","review":"So I downloaded this app abt a week ago because I am a “🌝loyal trump supporter🌝 but anyways this morning I woke up to go feed my roof and I was getting up a dragon 🐉 flew from under my bed and grabbed my phone as it chanted “✨ 𝓣𝓻𝓾𝓶𝓹 2020 𝓫𝓾𝓽 𝓸𝓷 𝓪 𝓰𝓻𝓪𝓿𝓮 𝓼𝓽𝓸𝓷𝓮 𝓲𝓯 𝔂𝓸𝓾 𝓭𝓸𝓷’𝓽 𝓭𝓮𝓵𝓮𝓽𝓮 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓪𝓹𝓹 𝓘 𝔀𝓲𝓵𝓵 𝓵𝓲𝓰𝓱𝓽 𝓾𝓻 𝓱𝓸𝓾𝓼𝓮 𝓸𝓷 𝓯𝓲𝓻𝓮✨” and the loyal orange 🍊 supporter I am I didn’t give up my phone and then the dragon said “I told you so” and huffed and puffed and then burnt down my house his breath was just as hot as our air due to global warming wutch is obviously a hoax 🙄✨ and then as my house was burning sonic the  hedgehog\nShowed up outside and asked to borrow my phone and saw the trump app and stole my phone and took my shoes so this is why you should not download this app😡😡🙄🤚","date":"2020-07-09T05:49:52Z","userName":"wow635","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174901347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App","review":"I am so very disappointed with the functionality of this app. All I wanted was to witness the most sacred message from our deal leader and all I get is this slow, broken, physically impossible to use application for my cellular tellular. I am so very offended that you would treat my GOD GIVEN president this way and I hope that the lord may someday reign His powers down unto these terrible app creators and smite them for their deceitfulness and faithless behavior at the expense of our dear leader. Everyday our nation is threatened by the lawlessness of the non-believers, the non-believers in TRUMP OUR LORD. I would sell my kidneys and heart to support my dear leader. I wouldn’t sell my heart because my Sacred Orange has already stolen it. I demand to have this sinful app REMOVED from the App Store as to not soil the name of our dear leader.","date":"2020-07-09T03:37:01Z","userName":"Mikismom24","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174849432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"app didn’t make me racist OR homophobic after downloading","review":"when i downloaded the app i thought it would make me hate black people and ignore the fact they have been systematically oppressed since the start of that country but it made me realize the president is a terrible baby and if he doesn’t get his way he will cry like a little bunker boy. the app also didn’t make me want to have my children go to conversion therapy if they came out to me other a heterosexual, so weird thought it would do that. the app also didn’t make me not want to wear my mask during a global panic with hundreds of thousands of people are dying.\nso weird because i thought that was the point of the app i might have to delete it. lastly, i don’t recommend this app to anyone.","date":"2020-07-09T03:21:51Z","userName":"bunkerboy2000","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174744318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Read pls 👉🏼👈🏼🥺","review":"This is the worse app you could possibly  think off. When I started reading it made my mouth glitch and itch. It started to call a immigrant and even told me to go back to my country. It called me horrible things to the point Where it almost made me loose my hearing. If you are a Mexican I recommend to not use this app for your own good if you don’t want to get butthurt also lots of mean Karen but they ain’t worth my time. I had to got to the doctor to because my stomach was in pain I through up 3 times today because of just opening this app and I almost lost my hearing and just seeing the president on the app made me loose my eyesight for 15 min straight... anyways use this app at your own risk.😭✨😍❤️😘🧚🏻👉🏼👈🏼🥺👁👄👁🤡💦🤪🥴😊😡🌸🤡💛💚💜💙❤️💕🧚🏻✨🧚🏻😔","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:22Z","userName":"bRiZa🥴","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174742178","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"waste of space 🧚","review":"i was very excited to download this app and receive tons of information about our super kind and not at all racist president. however, as soon as i opened it, i began to ran into problems. it often glitches, constantly runs slow, and completely drains my battery. it also asked for my phone number..... excuse me?? i do NOT feel comfortable giving my personal information to an oompa loompa. still, i figured i would give it the benefit of doubt and continue using it seeing that i am very passionate about learning more on our totally not homophobic, sexist, a predatory president’s 2020 campaign. UNTIL i woke up this morning to see that the app literally stole my mattress, killed my pet hamster, and ate all of my hot cheeetos. truly disappointed.","date":"2020-07-09T02:49:43Z","userName":"erinnnnaaannnna","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174601594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible!!","review":"I got this app even though I had seen all of the bad reviews. I still had hope that it was gonna be different but I was deeply disappointed 😔. First When I opened the app it popped up a picture of an orange 🍊 and it froze the screen. It wouldn’t let me leave so after like an hour I had to get it fixed and finally the orange disappeared but after, I accidentally opened the app again trying to delete it (which it wouldn’t let me do btw) it changed my background and all the pictures of the apps on my phone to trump and I couldn’t change it back I ended up having to buy a completely NEW phone so I just wasted A LOT of money on this app and I never even used it. NEVER GET THIS APP IT I had to spend hundreds of dollars bcs of this","date":"2020-07-09T02:08:38Z","userName":"albakarivalechaco","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174423917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WARNING GIVES YOUR PHONE A VIRUS.","review":"If possible I wouldn’t even give this app a star. They app gives you a horrible virus that you’re unable to get rid of no matter how hard you try. I’ve had the virus since 2016. It started as something so insignificant. I thought that it would just slow down my phone. But no it did much worse!! This app brought the racist, homophobia’s, sexiest, the list could go on & on out. My phone isn’t even the same phone anymore. It’s filled with hate & Facebook news lovers. On top of it it’s absolutely ruined my bank account. It’s brought it’s friend coronavirus & lord them to together is an absolute horror. 10/10 would not recommend this app. As soon as you think it can’t do more damage it shows you just horrible it is.","date":"2020-07-09T01:17:24Z","userName":"ShelloitsD","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174423173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"absolutely DISGUSTING 😾😾😾","review":"when you first open the app it says in bold letters “ALL LIBERALS MUST DIE” and then when you click more info it will show a video of you getting killed!!!! like live footage of YOU getting killed!!!!!!!!! when you click the trump gathering section it will show you videos of trump doing ballet in his tighty whities! HIS TIGHTY WHITIES! it’s absolutely appalling and it’s an awful site to see. my grandma clicked on it by accident and she had a heart attack(she’s dead now btw). i spoke to her ghost and she said part of the reason was actually bc she had to see trumps ugly face but the main reason was the ballet video. anyway tho, this app suckssss😹😹 and of you don’t wanna see trumps little weenie in his undies doing ballet and you want to your killing to be live-streamed i wouldn’t download this app!!!","date":"2020-07-09T01:17:09Z","userName":"Maddieandallie","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
