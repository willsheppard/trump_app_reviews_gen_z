It gave me multiple viruses and it is a direct threat to Apple. Please do not download this app it is dangerous. I think they sell the data on my browser to China. Also it’s all about a giant Cheeto and I don’t understand why it’s on the App Store in the first place. 0/10"}},{"id":"6174468486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:30:51Z","title":"burnt cheeto","userName":"genz will fix the world","review":"this is one of the worst apps i have ever gotten. when i opened the app all it showed was a photo of a burnt cheeto, it was so disgusting that my phone couldn’t handle it and blew up and then the explosion caused my dog to get hit and almost died and then now my brother blamed me for it when it was actually this cheeto person on my phone. so in conclusion do not get this app because your phone will blow up because of how disgusting the picture is then your dog will almost die from the explosion and then your family will be mad at you because of a cheeto"}},{"id":"6174454475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:26:37Z","title":"i felt disgusted 🤮","userName":"paizertazer","review":"this app is all around just disgusting i mean who is this orange pumpkin with a tiny peine all over this app, it’s honestly horrifying and scarring. i have never un installed an app quicker i just couldn’t look at this perverts face anymore i felt sick to my stomach. this app is NOT AT ALL enjoyable, educating or interesting all i see is a president with a muffin top 😬"}},{"id":"6174448577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:24:50Z","title":"Uhhh no ma’am","userName":"what is even that?","review":"So I was sitting in my room and then I was like let’s find an app about trump so I found one and was like ok I opened it and my phone really so oh no hunny what is this and my phone exploded I am typing on my moms phone I hope her phone doesn’t explode too but then after that my phone looked like a crispy Cheeto I am so sad now and phonless"}},{"id":"6174447531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:24:31Z","title":"Upset I can’t place negative reviews","userName":"ongaziwa","review":"I don’t understand why someone would even want an app named “T 2020”. This ridiculous app is rated the “#1 news” app when that is not what I’m gaining from this app at all. It is a waste of time and space. I can’t even stand having it downloaded. Negative infinity stars from me."}},{"id":"6174440706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:24Z","title":"Disgusted 🤢 can this app get any worse 🤮","userName":"judyjudybuttfutie","review":"Honestly this app needs to go every time I open it it starts glitching and it’s very annoying and terrible and it’s would always show an inappropriate photo and it’s just sad to see this type of app here how is it still here it’s NEEDS TO BE TAKEN DOWN❗️❗️❗️❗️ this app is not it 🤢🤢❌🚫‼️"}},{"id":"6174438369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:43Z","title":"Big no","userName":"lamasbonitadelmundohajaja","review":"I got this app to follow the trump rallies but all I see is an ugly big head cheeto looking creature. When I tell you I was beyond disgusted. I had nightmares for about a week. I honestly might need therapy after seeing that ugly face. Worst app I have ever downloaded. Took forever to load too! 10/10 would NOT recommend."}},{"id":"6174432109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:19:49Z","title":"Epileptic attack caused by Trump","userName":"ggegdvvsvs","review":"This app is terrible!!! I opened the app and saw flashing lights, so many that it gave me an epileptic attack. I had to be rushed to the hospital and almost died. Next I saw a huge inflated Cheeto. I passed out at the sight of this and had another epileptic attack!! Do not download if you don’t want to have an epileptic attack and see a huge inflated Cheeto!"}},{"id":"6174424575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:17:35Z","title":"Nope","userName":"_daniiirivera","review":"The manny will not be televised. The nerve how some people still wanting to run for president, yet a whole generation disagrees with his platform and continues to look ridiculous in front of the entire world is just a person who doesn’t deserve to continue splitting people up and causing more pain and chaos to the U.S. Not my president 😷👁👄👁💅👹"}},{"id":"6174414785","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:14:36Z","title":"Trash💩","userName":"jaja7134","review":"The app is almost as useless as the person who paid for it. First off they have a terrible crusty Cheeto with an awful wig on the home page. 10 out of 10 do not recommend. After I texted the number they said if I don’t pay $100 then they would take away my pet dinosaur. DO NOT GET THE APP."}}]}
