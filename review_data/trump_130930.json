However, as soon as I downloaded it, my phone started glitching out and making weird noises 🥴 then, the lights in my house started flickering. Additionally, when I opened my phone there was a picture of the cheetoh man himself petting some frogs 🐸 this was quite confusing. I shook it off and went outside for a walk. However, when I returned home, my family was gone! The Cheetoh man took him and my French fries! I then concluded he was a little bit nuts (and gave off Massimo vibes, -25985/10 tho because he’s old and bad spray tan). So I went on my phone to delete the app, but my background changed to a picture of the Cheetoh man eating peanut butter 🥜 straight out the jar with his dirty fingernails 🤢 which was very disturbing. I proceeded to go and delete the app and just as I was about to press delete, my grandma called and said that her fish died, and she also mentioned that she commented on a #saveBarron post that told Barron to spiritually kill her fish if he was ever in trouble. This was crazy news because it meant Barron is in trouble and must be saved😱! So obviously this is a lot of information, but I give this app a one star because it ruined my life and cursed me with stinky breath and fish feet (no, seriously). I will be expecting a full refund as well as my PTSD Therapy sessions to be paid for by Trump himself. Hope this was of use!","date":"2020-07-09T01:27:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"a tulipa","rating":1,"title":"Stinky tuna sandwich 😳🤮🦧"}},{"id":"6174456341","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I open the app to see Donald trumps nudes and him shoving a burrito up his butt I do not recommend this app to anyone I don’t even know why the president of the United States is creating such horrendous applications like these","date":"2020-07-09T01:27:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"lqisoxbbzj","rating":1,"title":"Absolutely disgusting"}},{"id":"6174456321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽⍀⏃⏁⏃⌿⏃⍀⏃⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⎍⋔⎍👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍀⏃⏁⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⌰⏃⏁⟒⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⋔⍜⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍜⌰⋔⟒⋏⏃👽⎅⟒⌿⏃⎅⏃⍀⟟👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽 ⎅⟟⋔⟒⎅⏃⟒👽","date":"2020-07-09T01:27:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ayo ailen","rating":1,"title":"ew"}},{"id":"6174455938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"☆☆☆☆☆☆▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅ ☆☆☆☆☆☆▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅ ☆☆☆☆☆☆▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅🔥 ▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅🔥🔥 ▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅🔥🔥🔥▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅🔥🔥🔥🔥","date":"2020-07-09T01:27:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"the devil LUCIFER MORNINGSTAR","rating":1,"title":"AWFUL APP!!!"}},{"id":"6174455711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍ𝓨ᗴᔕ 🤷𝓼𝓸𝓶𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓶𝓮𝓼✨𝓲☹️𝓭𝓸𝓷'𝓽😢𝔀𝓪𝓷𝓷𝓪😱𝓫𝓮😼𝓱𝓪𝓹𝓹𝔂🧚𝓭𝓸𝓷'𝓽✋𝓱𝓸𝓵𝓭😇𝓲𝓽🤪𝓪𝓰𝓪𝓲𝓷𝓼𝓽😈𝓶𝓮🙆","date":"2020-07-09T01:27:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dhidjdjndbd","rating":1,"title":"Stinky 🤮🤢🤧"}}]}
