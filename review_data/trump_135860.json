But when I opened it for the first time, I suddenly got an overwhelming feeling that spread to the very depths of my body. It was like that feeling you get when your pee burns. I thought it was just the squirrel I had eaten earlier that day, so I paid no mind. I spent hours staring avidly at Daddy D’s saggy facial features, memorizing the wrinkles of his face. It wasn’t until the next day that I realize there was a problem. It started with a few phone calls, where all I heard was heavy breathing and a sultry whisper “no feelings just facts..” when the other side suddenly hung up. This went on for several days.  I was confused, but maybe it was just my cousin? Then there were emails. Several thousand per day pleading for me to donate to the 2020 campaign. There were several that were somewhat threatening. “Daddy would want you to. Trump 2020.. Trump 2020.. Trump 2020..” I was frightened.. I know Daddy would want me to. So I did, hoping it would all go away. I was starting to get nightmares. I recall one where I was in a dark bunker. I knew Daddy would be down there so I initially felt safe... until I saw it. A figure was approaching me from the darkness, and as the light illuminated it’s skin I realized it was orange. His toupee was askew and the straw like texture was emphasized by the greasy sweat that trickled down every fold in his face. The mouth was open wide and the eyes— how they burned through me. “Trump 2020” was the last thing heard before I woke up. It was one of those nights when someone knocked on my door. They wore white masks. I felt comforted by the white, so I let them in. After speaking with them I attended several of their meetings, and performed rituals with some aliens to ensure Daddy’s win in the next election. I was comforted by the whispers on the phone. By the emails. By the dreams. There’s promo code R4CIST in the app to join our meetings! There every Sunday at 12 in your nearest forest! All in all, this app may make you feel sick at first, stalk you, and steal your information, but it helped me find my cu— I mean meeting leader. I love you Daddy D!","title":"Stole my information","userName":"jalapenopepperchild","date":"2020-06-11T22:33:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6064622672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"SOMEONE HACKED INTO MY CREDIT CARD AND BOUGHT $420.69 IN BUTT PLUGGS","title":"Don’t like this app but great market for selling my toe pics","userName":"berreli","date":"2020-06-11T22:27:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6064600790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was looking to download this app in support of our holy beloved president Donald J Trump but became severely disappointed when i found out I'm so bad I'm so bad 늘 뻔한 다-다-답 길게도 blah blah blah 더 늘어지기 전에 보란 듯이 걸러, 겁내지 마 골라 봐 자 tic tak toe O 아님 X 잖니 (ha!) 더 크게 sho-shout! 너답게 ho-hot!

He came to me last night, slowly caressing my cheek and told me to download the app. Now, I don’t what download means (I’m a 105 year old male) but download is close to donald so I figured it was ok. Well after I donalded the “app” donald came back to my house and was much less gentle this time. Let’s just say, even hitler didn’t have the audacity to do the things to me that this orange son of a beech did. My anal cavity is still sore from the ravaging that man did to me. Please call an ambulance as I’m pretty sure even jesus is afraid of what he’s done to me. To quote my favorite war movie, “do you think god stays in heaven because he too fears his creation on earth” Stay frosty men. And get rid of this digital butt ravager of an app while you still can...","title":"Donald WHYYYY","userName":"Hi2013ueuwieuie","date":"2020-06-11T21:46:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6064515696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Donkey: oh this is another one of does onion things isn't \nShrek/Blind Mouse: no this is one of does drop it and leave it alone things\n\nShrek/Blind Mouse: This is the part where you run away!\n\nDonkey: Hey, come back there.
