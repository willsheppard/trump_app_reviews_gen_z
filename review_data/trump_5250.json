Unfortunately, the opposite happened. Last night, I was just hitting my REM cycle when satan himself walked into my room in the form of an orange man who walked at a 45¬∞ angle. Needless to say, I was shocked. He came up to me and spoke in incoherent sentences trying to convince me that he was, in fact, Harry styles. In other words, he was impersonating god (!!!!). Eventually I was able to outrun him, but I had to spend the night in the rug isle of home depot. Overall, I do not recommend this app, unless you want this to happen to you.","title":"üëÅüëÑüëÅ","date":"2020-07-09T15:01:21Z","userName":"cowgirl katie ü§†","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177023206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app literally works horribly. Whenever I first downloaded it WHICH TOOK A MONTH, I saw what I thought was annoying orange pop up but it turned out to just be Trump. The app hacked into all my other apps and everytime I tried to open another app ‚ÄúVote Trump the rapist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, wanting us to inject bleach to cure corona, racist and most disrespectful president we‚Äôve had yet back into office!!‚Äù I think that catchphrase hit right on point!

Disgusting. My little sister was in the room with me and almost started crying. So these people want to torture all children, young and old, with such a horrific picture? Second, the app crashes constantly before I could even sign up. That is not an app I would want to be on. Third, why would I want to give my personal information to an app the could potentially be scamming me for a vote?
