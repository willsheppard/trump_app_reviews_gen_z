There’s an unreasonable amount of glitches when I open the app and even when it’s closed! Sometimes at night I hear the National Anthem gradually get louder and louder and when I look over, Trumps face is smiling at me! Very disturbing and just plain rude! I need my beauty sleep! It’s also quite annoying that I tried to delete the app but when I opened my phone the next day it was there! Just an invasion of privacy! I just don’t know what to say, the app needs to be removed! It is a menace to society and an overall annoyance that I don’t have time to put up with! Someone needs to do something and they need to do it now!"}},{"id":"6174523164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:46:14Z","title":"MOST TERRIBLE APP EVER🤢🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"natalieefingcarmicheal","review":"i wanted to download this app to get updates for the campaign and when i went on the app CHEETO BOYS NUDES WERE LEAKED!! it was the most terrifying experience i’ve ever have to endure on this planet earth. when i saw this horrific image i immediately fell to the ground. my mom heard the fall from downstairs and SPRINTED into my room to find me on the ground passed out. she then saw the terrifying image of cheeto man nood and projectile vomited all over my brand new white faux fur rug. she rushed me to the hospital and the nurse asked her what happened and she had to show the horrifying image to the nurse who then collapsed to the ground because she couldn’t handle the sight of cheeto boys nude wrinkled body. i was in a coma for months. im ok now but i will never forget this terrifying experience of seeing cheeto boy nude😩"}},{"id":"6174476306","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:33:09Z","title":"remove this app immediately","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"😘🥰🥰🥰😇💕","review":"I downloaded this app so I could learn more about trump’s political views. Oddly, upon downloading it, I got a knock on my front door. As I opened the door I was immediately choke slammed by a lopsided Cheeto. He then saw my dog running to help me and drop kicked him out the window. Thankfully, he is still ok. Just as I tried to get onto my feet, Cheeto Jr came out of nowhere and started singing “I write sins not tragedies” by panic at the disco aggressively into my ear. It was in this moment that my grandma came into the room and Cheeto began demanding for her to “build the wall.” My grandma asked him to wear a mask to which he responded by doing a back flip into a roundhouse kick and kicked her into a closet. We are still paying for therapy. This app is a complete invasion of privacy."}},{"id":"6174421568","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:16:39Z","title":"✨rip trump✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"By gracetheoceanqueen","review":"Wow I have no words to describe how horrifying this is. I originally downloaded this app to pay respects to our beloved Cheeto Man but sadly I was very disappointed. When I first opened the app, a mini Cheeto man came out of the screen and spit in my eye. My eye won’t open and there is a strange orange rash spreading on my body. I am very concerned for my friends and family because since this incident they have been complaining about seeing a small orange man eating the Cheetos and cackling like mad. Because of my blindness I’m now unable to drive to Taco Bell and my friends and family have left the country. Now I am hungry, blind, and alone 🤧✌️If you care about your loved ones and your eyesight please do not download this app. To sum up, this app needs to 🧚🏼d i e 🧚🏼"}},{"id":"6174418302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:15:40Z","title":"Rick pickle man say no no to Cheeto man app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"manny hefly","review":"My name rick pickle man I eat pickles for a living.

When I looked again to confirm my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me, an actual corpse was standing there !!!! It’s finger nails were crispy and it’s straw like hair was so greasy it was falling off its head 😳. It’s turkey neck was flowing in the wind, stretching more and more with each second I looked at it. It’s bloated belly was pointed towards me, expanding more and more. It’s complexion was a horrible bright shade of orange, as if it had just soaked in a bath full of hot dog water and Cheeto puffs. Under closer inspection it seemed to be crustier than I was expecting, it’s thin chapped lips about to dissolve under a the light and it’s nose probably crumbling to the touch. I just know it’s crispy."}},{"id":"6174308216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:40:24Z","title":"absolutely disgusting","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"shane pedo yaw","review":"i will not and cannot even get far enough into the app with out being sick to my stomach 🙄 i've tried everything i can just so i can see if this app is worth the storage on my phone...and quite frankly...ITS NOT!!!! as soon as u get onto the app there is this spinning wheel right in front of ur face and it makes my motion sickness go wild. not to add they want you to sign up and make an account, they want to take my phone number and/or my email..THATS WAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION TO JUST BE GIVING OUT PRESIDENT TRUMP!! as soon as i saw mr trumps fist in the air as it loaded, i immediately got ptsd from when i got punched in 7th grade by a white male. i will not let this go on, this app does not and will not receive any type of positive outlook. i hate here 😔😔😔😔"}},{"id":"6174263681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:25:11Z","title":"Bad beliefs","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Josehtxlv","review":"The people who believe in QAnon and Trump think the Ashkenazi Jews run the world behind scenes and that they are plotting “white genocide” in revenge of the holocaust! That is pure mental illness, The Jews aren’t doing anything and they still hate them for no reason other than they believe they are the superior race! They think they should have a white america for themselves as an ethnostate and keep brown and Jewish people out! That’s just crazy! They hate Jews, they are literal NAZIS! All of the things they believe about Jews are false, and, even if they were real, there is nothing they can do to stop DIVERSITY or their so called “white genocide” Black people will be moving into your neighborhood, sorry white fragile Nazis, you will never get the white ethnostate you cry so much for on the internet"}},{"id":"6174225427","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:11:40Z","title":"Tehe🧟\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"migy2626","review":"Hi my name is Suga's big juicy coc- i mean Thighs. When i downloaded this so called 𝒂𝒑𝒑 I saw a naked man when i opened it. Then my bed started levetating. My fridge went missing and so did my trump supporting step father that i canceled. My dog flew across my room. My cat turned into a giraffe my mom is nowhere to be seen. i turned off my phone and took a nap for 3 hours, then when i opened it the naked man was my home screen and lock screen when it was suppose to be Tobio Kageyama. This app brought demons into my house including my grandma. Then my cheetos started attacking me and my amazingly beautiful bts albums. I finally deleted the app then whent back to sleep for another 1 hour. This 𝒂𝒑𝒑 is no good. \nMy earings gone!

First, I was greeted by a picture of an orange man getting a spray tan naked. I was scared and now need to go to therapy at least 14 times a week because of the discomfort I had felt looking at that photo. My eyes had fallen out and I was completely disgusted at this photo. Second, the same man that was getting a spray tan naked was in a suit claiming he was the president of the United States. I refuse to even imagine that an orange man is our president. I think the app would be more enjoyable if it never existed, because nobody would have to look at those disgusting photos. I am going to give this app a one star rating for the photos and just being on the app store in general."}}]}
