The app looks really bad as if a 2 year old designed it not to mention it was really glitchy and made my phone hot. Later that day I was deleting it and when my dog saw the pic he started throwing up🤮he should just drop out of the election and become the Cheetos mascot but I’d rather not see his saggy turkey neck in front of a Cheetos bag he should just go back to the tanning salon 😌✨💅🏽🦋💕"}},{"id":"6174292078","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cameron boyce's gf","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"very harmful and not kid friendly😔","date":"2020-07-09T00:35:03Z","review":"First off, My 5 year old nephew opened the app and there was a porn ad.🤢 ew gross I know.

He was like “VOTE FOR ME OR I WILL BUY YOUR FAMILY” which is a very unpleasant thing to hear. Next thing I know the fbi is at my door taking away my family. And then they take me. I wake up in the Oval Office, tied up against my parents and my brother. I somehow got out and saved my family but I know this isn’t the last I will see of Cheeto man."}},{"id":"6174284481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"savebarron69","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Made me vomit for several hours","date":"2020-07-09T00:32:31Z","review":"Decided to download this app to stay informed, but all it did was cause me deep emotional and physical pain. Mr. Cheeto Poopy Pants was the first image that appeared, and next thing I knew I was in the bathroom throwing up the delicious 5 star meal I had just spent $69 dollars on. This man has taken so much from so many people, and now it is time for this disgusting horrific vile app to be taken away from him, as well as the whole presidency. We don’t want any of it."}},{"id":"6174269083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"llaurrr","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"insulting","date":"2020-07-09T00:27:07Z","review":"I first opened this app expecting to learn about the campaign. But the minute I did my Alexa starting singing “Trump 2020” in the voice of Tony the Tiger. Then shortly after a truck load of boxes were delivered to my house, filled with copious amounts of Cheetos, spray tan supplies, and blonde wigs that look like they were made for an SNL character. Since then my cat has become possessed and will only eat the shoes of Barbie dolls. Not to mention every morning at 2 AM it shoots lasers out of its eyes."}}]}
