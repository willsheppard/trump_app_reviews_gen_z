So I did my civic duty and downloaded this app, and was met only with bloodshed and tragedy. This app stole all of my information and sent it to CHINA! Secret services appeared at my house, kidnapped me, and held me hostage for 63 days. During that time I was indoctrinated with the words of bunker baby boy. When i returned home everything I loved had vanished. 1/5 stars would not recommend."}},{"id":"6176895076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"crashes","userName":"kanye can make a better app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:16:52Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I’m not sure what all the other one stars are on about because their stories make no sense. I truly did want to download this app because of our great leader president Trump. But as soon as I opened the app it asked for a lot of my information which I am not comfortable with because it infringes on my rights. and then once I put in my information it kept crashing! I’m very disappointed in what our fearless and intelligent leader has provided us.

And when it actually did download, it crashed and I had to buy an entirely new phone because it destroyed everything on mine. I would not recommend this app, and it should not even be allowed in the App Store 🐸🙊 I also did not appreciate his nudes that popped up in my feed. It was disturbing and inappropriate.

I downloaded it to show my ✨support✨ to our God President Donald J. Trump but it’s done everything but that. Someone said the app took 76 weeks to download, mine took 89 years and then my phone exploded💥. When I finally did get to use the app my house exploded💥. When I asked for compensation, they told me to “Shut my communist liberal mouth up” and we love our administration for destroying libtards on a daily🥰 I’d give this 0/5 stars but I can’t 💕"}},{"id":"6176624766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app was horrible🤬😤","userName":"bigoleloser","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:05:38Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app for..well who knows why but it’s terrible I opened it and the first thing to come up was a sex tape of kin kardashian, then it sent out my location and made my whole phone crash it also took 5 days to download and when it finally did it took up all the storage on my whole phone and was just a big old problem.

EXTREMELY CREEPY. I WONDER WHAT ELSE IS ACTUALLY GOING ON THAT WE DONT KNOW ABOUT. I am one of the few people that actually READS the terms & conditions and there’s SEVERAL clauses that basically grant the app access to MY ENTIRE PHONE INCLUDING PHOTOS NOTES AND MESSAGES. SOMEONE WILL SEE MY NUDES.

Once opened it requires a phone number in order to do anything and nobody should feel comfortable giving their number to the scum of the earth. I would give 0 stars if that was possible, but it’s not so here I am giving a detailed review about how it is clearly the worst app in existence. Please stay away from this app in order to keep your personal information safe, and to not be accused of supporting a racist and homophobic piece of crap."}},{"id":"6176358590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app i have ever seen","userName":"20394947572919","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:52:36Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So first of all i tried to download this app to support the best president of all time.

I just got my 11 pro max and as soon as I put this app on everything begin to glitch.

Deleted the app all problems solved. Wow."}}]}
