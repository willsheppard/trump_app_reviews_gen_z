It’s all Donald Trump pictures, slogans, and sounds that spam your screen. The sound overlaps with the constant repetition of “make america great again”. Even when I exited the app the sounds were at full volume. This app doesn’t allow you to do anything but look at and listen to the horror of Donald Trump’s voice and pictures. I’m ✨scared✨. I went to apple support and they made me get a new phone because it turns out this app has hacked all of my information and the CIA still shows up at my house every evening and forces me to make them dinner. Please delete this app and your presidency🥰✨🧚","title":"DISAPPOINTED✨🧚","date":"2020-07-08T23:55:27Z","userName":"IdontthinkweareinKansas","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174066880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see my favorite hot cheeto👻 when i discovered a rat🤨. this was very uncalled for as my very average dog martha ate it and then dog food poisoning😎. then we took her to the hospital only to find a debby ryan shrine🤪. next, we rushed to the emergency room where ”𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣” was playing👁👄👁. we settled martha down on the bed to wait for a doctor👩🏻\u200D🦲. none other than madison beer, the pisces sun💧herself greeted us at the bed🧚🏻. she then gave martha plastic surgery without her consent🧏🏻\u200D♀️. we rushed out of the hospital with martha who now appeared to be tiktok sensation charli damelio🤩. so, furthermore i do not recommend this app because my poor average dog martha is now charli damelio🧑🏻\u200D🦯. i did however give you one star because i got to meet charli😌🐒.","title":"🤩OOMPA LOOMPA🤪","date":"2020-07-08T23:13:18Z","userName":"😼🐒🤪","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173947101","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have never been more disappointed by an app before. When I just opened it, I noticed a few glitches here and there. Nothing too bad, just the screen freezing up, pop up ads not letting me exit out, etc. BUT, then it got worse. The app somehow managed to leak my entire photo gallery out. A trump account tweeted each of my photos one by one?? Then, my address got leaked! And finally, my social security number too! My family is scared for our lives because of this app, my life will never be the same. Please DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. This app in itself is a betrayal to the hardworking Americans of our great country. I still cannot believe Trump’s administration has let this happen. He has lost my vote.","title":"Horrible, awful, worst app ever.","date":"2020-07-08T22:28:12Z","userName":"Barry McKrokiner","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173856793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ateez win lyrics: \n\nOh ya ya ya (hey)\nOh ya ya ya\nPlay like a rocky, like him (rocky, rocky)\nNow we gon' be winning like that\nOh mamama 지평선은 뒤로 (hey)\nAnd we mamama 첫 번째로 디뎌\n깃발은 펄럭이게 하늘 위로 저 하늘 위로\n저 하늘 위로\n파도가 막아?\n그냥 가르고 나가\n바람이 때려?\n그 바람 타고 날아\nDon't ask me why why why why 몰라 (몰라)\n그냥 가는 거야 앞이 있잖아\nWe don't know\nWhat is next\n생각하지 않지 우린 live today\nBut we know\nWho is next\n우리가 어디 있는지를 봐\n우리 배는 편도로만 가\nHey, hey we are gonna win (rocky, rocky, rocky, yeah)\nHey, we are gonna win (rocky, rocky, rocky, yeah)\nWe are gonna win\nWe are gonna win (rocky, rocky, rocky, yeah)\nWe are gonna win, ah\n어머나 웬 난리야\n우리는 널널해 날라리야\n어 치고받고 또 싸움이야?\n난 몰라 유유히 콧노래야 아라리요\nGet on up, we gon' lit 불 지펴\n지평선 끝까지 움직여 날아 같이\n피어난 꽃처럼 흘려놔 blow away\n이 땅을 물들여 지구 한 바퀴\n파도가 막아?\n그냥 가르고 나가\n바람이 때려?\n그 바람 타고 날아\nDon't ask me why why why why 몰라 (몰라)\n그냥 가는 거야 앞이 있잖아\nWe don't know\nWhat is next\n생각하지 않지 우린 live today\nBut we know\nWho is next (who is next)\n우리가 어디 있는지를 봐\n우리 배는 편도로만 가 (hey)\nHey, we are gonna win (rocky, rocky, rocky, yeah)\nHey, we are gonna win (rocky, rocky, rocky, yeah)\nWe are gonna win\nWe are gonna win (rocky, rocky, rocky, yeah)\nWe are gonna win\n이젠 다 우리의 것 eh 춤을 춰 우리답게\n욕심을 채워 계속 축배를 들어 다 같이\nWe gon' be winning all day\nWe gon' be winning all day night\nWe gon' be winning all day\nWe gon' be winning all day night\nOne, two, one, two, three, go","title":"✨𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣 𝘼𝙏𝙀𝙀𝙕🤩🧚🏽✨","date":"2020-07-08T21:55:03Z","userName":"xxxkodyxxx","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173574609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought this app was going to be the PERFECT 💕🧚🏻👨\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👨 way to keep in touch with everything our GREAT 👍🏻 🤩 president has to say, but it turns out it’s nothing but 😫FAKE NEWS 😕This app took YEARS 🕑🕖🕝 to download📲.

Once it downloaded, it said that i had to run through the streets with the pet of my choice attached to a TRUMP 2020 sign, so I did. My dog is no longer with us, rest in piece Shart Pie😿After that horrible tragedy, it said i had to pay either $383 or a blood sacrifice from a healed covid patient. I stole a car and drove it illegally to snatch up some of my uncles blood🩸🤠. What can I say, i would do anything to see what the app is actually about, so after the death of my dog 😑🥺 and the sacrifice of my uncle 🦠👁👅👁 the app said it was failing, and i had to delete it before my phone exploded and took out everything up to 834 miles.

I’ve always had a phobia of oranges and they have the audacity to put it as the login screen. I was just trying to support my king donald duck only to find out it wasn’t about donald duckling😔 i find this old crusty man (which now that i think back he might’ve been the tangerine i saw earlier) standing in front of an American flag but I guess he was just trying to be “hot” because girls always find it hot when guys stand in front of things they’ve destroyed😝 His saggy skin gave me the shivers and he looks as if we was being suffocated by his crusted, dusted, musted, rusted and busted republican red tie.

She couldn’t breathe. She thought this was a porn app. But when she saw “TRUMP 2020” it sent her to the hospital. I don’t know if she’s okay. But your app is so bad. It caused all my family to almost die. And it’s incredibly slow and it makes my family suffer more. They supported you until you gave them these health issues. And by the looks of it, you caused many deaths. Don’t install. Horrible app. Please take it down before more innocent lives are taken. 🤡 you guys are clowns if you keep it up.
