Now after the app had downloaded and I signed in and all that they asked me SUPER personal question like my address, what I was wearing, my FULL name, My age, etc. Oh but of course I just swiped in the app and deleted it DUH but the next day I noticed that weird things kept happening to me like my oven started by itself and so did my washer and dryer and without even doing anything my SIRI kept go on and off asking me weird question like why did you delete the app. By now I figured I’m being hacked (which I was) so bc of this app I had to shut down my phone and everything just so that I could keep my info safe. Thank goodness this is all over but please DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS IS A WARNING!!!⚠️🚫","userName":"LordShheepe","title":"Hacked AND Personal info!!!!!!!!!!!!!!⚠️"}},{"id":"6179615501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:30:11Z","review":"This man is focused on TikTok and China while there is a global PANDEMIC I get that he does nothing but go against China but at least have the awareness that ppl are still dying","userName":"photon kirito","title":"I am sorry there is still a pandemic"}},{"id":"6179615498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:30:11Z","review":"I downloaded this app and all of a sudden a flock of ducks came through the door!

It’s a scam.  I was on the was to country club county and a fellow  Karen of mine told me about the app. I downloaded and everything keep on saying scam. Also we need to get rid of the gen z kids. I mean who do they they they are. My name is starkisha and you are watching Disney channel. Do you know anyone that sews. Can you just leave a comment below. Also Susan and Helen and bring potato salad and chips for the children on Saturday.  Susan said she will use just use raisins and sunflowers seed in case any of your children have a peanut allergy. What kind of cookies do you want. Also do any of you have a boat.  Me and my sisters would love to go tubing. Do you think one of you husbands could hire some to build a camp home for me and then say he built it with his bare hands. Have great day and tell bill to pick his grades up. He is starting to fall below average.","userName":"It's Deborah🤩","title":"Starkisha"}},{"id":"6179615113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:30:04Z","review":"Yes I know there is a trend going on but this app is glitching so bad","userName":"Teslamodel3xd","title":"It’s glitchy"}},{"id":"6179615134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:30:04Z","review":"chicken wing \nchicken wing\nhotdog and bologna \nchicken and macaroni \nchillin with my homies","userName":"china, iran, and russia","title":"bad"}},{"id":"6179615058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:30:03Z","review":"Not a good app for a rich billionaire rapist pedofile my uncle shoulda arrested you along with epstein but anyway this app is terrible do not download it at all.","userName":"josee.bosey","title":"Terrible waste of space like him"}},{"id":"6179615034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:30:02Z","review":"This is a really bad app as there are a lot of glitches in it.

I’ve never experienced anything that has made me this annoyed. The app immediately asks for my phone number which is super annoying. I don’t want texts from an orange. I have immediately deleted the app because why would I stay somewhere that wants my phone number. I mean give me some privacy am I right. Anyway if someone is looking for a reason to download the app just stop trying because you will only be extremely disappointed in the end. Have a nice day and remember and apple a day keeps the orange away ☺️🧚🏼\u200D♀️❤️💕✨⭐️🦋🧚🏼\u200D♂️💖💗🥰😘","userName":"21cc6","title":"Dumb as dumb can be"}}]}
