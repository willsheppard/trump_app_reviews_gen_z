Trump in the 2020 election. I am a big Trump supporter who goes back to 2016, and if I’m really being honest, this app has been terrible. It is slow, glitchy, and a waist of storage. The app constantly blacks out and closes. I cannot go one minute without it glitchy or blacking out. I can see why the ratings are so bad. I would highly recommend not getting this app, but instead going on to Foxnews.com. If you read this far, here’s my real opinion, 🖕🏼Trump!","rating":1,"title":"Horrible Experience With This App","userName":"Albert Ingus","date":"2020-07-09T23:36:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178630970","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took 5days to install and it killed my pet owl he looked at the big fat orange thing with lemon hair and he turned Orange and his Hair turned yellow so we had to put him down 😭😭😭😭 R.I.P Mr.owl","rating":1,"title":"So long to install","userName":"Nuts for birds","date":"2020-07-09T23:35:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178630248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It is just ass","rating":1,"title":"Uninstall","userName":"kaksmksimsmsux)smsjsjjsj","date":"2020-07-09T23:35:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178629572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"first of all this app took 365 days  to download , And when I opened the app it immediately asked for my phone number (like if he trynna slide in my dms do it better yk) , he really trynna get underaged girls phone numbers WHILE he’s married with 3 kids (which idk how it’s possible wit dat 2inch😒) AND besides all of that right after i put in my number , random numbers started texting me saying that they were stalking me so i immediately tried to delete this app but as i tried it kept playing trumps sex tape which made me go illegally blind nd as Mrs.Michele Obama drove me to the hospital that horrifying video kept playing in my head , so after i had my successful brain transplant and i finally came home , Mrs.Obama was kind enough to buy me a new phone , And if i could give this app ZERO STARS I WOULD.","rating":1,"title":"I went illegally blind","userName":"CHEETOHATER💅🏽🖕🏽","date":"2020-07-09T23:35:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178628050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"WHEN I OPENED THE APP MY PHONE CAUGHT ON FIRE AND THEN STARTED CUSSING AT ME AND TOLD ME THAT IT WAS GONNA RAPE ME!

Is Guam still a thing? Hm, I’ll look into that) I am both flabbergasted 😳 and thunderstruck 🤯 at how BAD this app is. Seriously do not waste your time or data on this government sanctioned listening device. Just last week I was telling my third cousin’s son that I needed a new thermostat for my goose hutch in the backyard, and LOW AN BEHOLD what am I advertised next on amazon?? A THERMOMETER THAT WOULD FOT PERFECTLY IM MY GOOSE HUTCH. (Too bad it clashes with the summertime in Switzerland decor 😞). I am *firmly* entrenched in the idea that this app not only is listening to my personal conversations, but leaking those convos to the pentagon itself, and then Amazon. Also, when I finally got past the download time (it took like a full soul cycle of the harvest moon to download... big YIKES) it had a video recorded message stating that don Trumpet would call me??? So finally, (after mercury went into metronome), he *did* call me, and he said: “baby do you love me” to which I hesitantly replied “only partly ✌🏻 I only love my 🛌 and my momma I’m sorry 😫” and BOY did he not like that. He threatened to take away my right to vote AND my geese!! Like please do not tell me that you’re going to take away Reginald Honkington the vice chancellor of Gooslevania all because of this app. Straight up NIGHTMARE. I was so prepared to dish the tea with my fellow trump supporters, and this is the thanks I get? 🤢 I wish I could get all those years off my life back.","rating":1,"title":"Not mad, just disappointed","userName":"Reesescup1114151213","date":"2020-07-09T23:33:22Z","isEdited":false}}]}
