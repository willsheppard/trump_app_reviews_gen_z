It does not allow for you to even have a glimpse of his campaign or information about him on the app unless you provide personal information and sign up for an account to be a part of his campaign by providing your mobile number. Definitely feels as exploitative as he is on TV and I do not support this app. Delete or don’t even download and you’ll be much better off 😊","userName":"Jaysuoe","rating":1}},{"id":"6176905977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:19:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Keeps crashing, being spammed","review":"I am being spammed with constant calls and texts after I gave them my number. It also doesn’t stop with random notifications. It takes up a lot of space and seemed to bug out my phone. Eventually I had to delete. Trumps app is just not as good as him, maybe he’s not the best candidate for everything after all. I’m disappointed in you Apple Store. Do better and just delete the headache from everyone else.","userName":"marberc","rating":1}},{"id":"6176860519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:07:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"SENT ME ALIENS?! *not clickbait*","review":"THIS APP SENT ME ALIENS!! i was relaxing in my ✨mediocre✨ apartment when i downloaded the app. the app looks horrible which is already a no❤️ from mama and secondly the app hacked my ip address and in minutes an alien was at my door asking for my milky ( . )( . )🤩😻🥛 ofc i gave him some and me and him together are writing this review its just cannot not cool to take him away from his space ya know, ill let him do some talkin’ now\n\ni🥵climed🧭out🥫of👋my🔒head🤯and⛸watched⏰myself👈implode💥a👅thought💭without ❌a⚠️body💤 oughta🎤be🐝the🏎 shot🔫","userName":"mdodnf3739","rating":1}},{"id":"6176820920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:57:22Z","isEdited":false,"title":"NIGHTMERE!!!!","review":"The first night I downloaded this app I was sent explicit pictures and videos of the presidents downtime. I am terrified! I then got a text telling me to bleach my eyes! But being the great American Trump Supporter I am i did bleach my eyes! My iris are now light blue and everything I look at is hazy! This morning at 3:39 AM I woke up in a cold sweat from nightmares about generation z! In the dream the skinned my cat! The hooligans who run this app must be behind this! Planting dreams in my head! Absurd!! I’m going to go cuddle with Mr. Kitty Fluffles (my little fur ball of a cat!) and cry!","userName":"Nala Finnet","rating":1}},{"id":"6176795240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:50:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"RUINED MY SEX LIFE","review":"absolutely disgusting the app took 9 hours to download and crashed 5 times in a row once i opened it it was okay but then when i closed it my life changed completely. i started to have horrible erectile dysfunction then my girlfriend broke up with me because it was too soft and bendy when i put it in and then i got a headache and it turned out it was a brain tumor i deleted the app and the next day it was there again so i deleted it again and it reappeared.

It took literally 10 hours to download and when I opened the app the first thing that showed up was a giant Cheeto dust covered Oompa Loompa, it hacked my phone and deleted all my contacts! This is the worst app EVER! Please, for everyone’s safety delete this off of the App Store cause this app is nasty, it ain’t your fault Apple. It’s this app, it’s infested. I think you should soak it in some rice or better yet throw it in a bathtub and instead of a bathbomb use a toaster.","userName":"TryingToArt","rating":1}}]}
