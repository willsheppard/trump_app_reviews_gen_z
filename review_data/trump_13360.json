Extremely unreliable, always showing me the wrong information. Had a orange type of tint to it, very hard on the eyes. Would constantly say racist and homophobic things. So very absurd of the app to do so. The layout is just terrible, seems like a toddler built it. Have never had an update feels like I’m stuck in the 1950s with this app. Probably built by a lot of bad hombres.","date":"2020-07-09T05:25:25Z"}},{"id":"6175120277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Joshthepianomaster","title":"HE ALMOST KILLED MY GRANDMA","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This creepy orange man literally startled my grandmother so much that she dropped her dentures in the toilet. There she was, minding her own business, scrolling before wiping, when BOOM, he came out the phone with his little hands and his shiny orange skin. Bewildered she flailed her arms up and he dentures went straight down into the poo toilet.
