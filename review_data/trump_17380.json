Then my mom died in a car accident and her last words to me were “dump trump “ and I was shook 😖 turns out this app is haunted and it kills everyone that’s dumb enough to think trump is a good president. ✨✨✨🌻🌻","date":"2020-07-09T14:25:35Z"}},{"id":"6176920724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Donald let me down :(","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"michael trenton","review":"I downloaded this app because I’m a huge MAGA supporter. But, like many of my fellow Republicans, Donald trump has been disappointing me recently. The app is full of tired content that gives me zero confident for the upcoming election. Thanks for nothing, Donald. Also, I had the problem that another user had where the app crashed my phone multiple times.","date":"2020-07-09T14:23:32Z"}},{"id":"6176857738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Unbelievable","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"hagajdbrjjevvsdjdhd","review":"Ever since I downloaded this app I automatically started getting phone calls and more people are getting killed because they aren’t white and straight. As soon as I put in my number seat cars and military ran in my house saying all lives matter and if I didn’t put a five star review I’d die. I give this a 0/5 wouldn’t recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T14:07:03Z"}},{"id":"6176790427","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Review","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Fun cra cra person!!!!!!!! lol","review":"I downloaded this app to know the rally dates so I could go but it started glitching really bad when I first opened the app I saw a Cheeto naked then trying to workout it was very disturbing then I went to my bedroom  and realized my bed was gone the went to the bathroom and the toilet and shower was gone this app steals things from your house it the evil Cheeto man you can’t trust him you never trust orange people","date":"2020-07-09T13:49:18Z"}},{"id":"6176734162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🌟🧚\u200D♀️💞please don’t download 💫🧚\u200D♂️✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"thanks_thanks","review":"This app is a complete waste of time and it took forever to download. If you also want to keep your dignity and wits about you, DO NOT download this app because it supports the exact organization that has made an uncountable amount of stupid decisions and supports a man who is sexist, racist and all the above. Please don’t download this app, it’s for your and your countries good 💕","date":"2020-07-09T13:34:29Z"}},{"id":"6176713403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this is the worst app on the app store","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"T2teddy","review":"i downloaded this app and IMMEDIATELY got a notification saying my knee caps would be broken if i did not vote for trump. i thought it must be a bug, but hours later two men showed up at my house with a metal crowbar. i have been on the run ever since and i am typing this from under a log.
