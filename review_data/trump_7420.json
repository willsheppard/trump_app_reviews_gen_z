Look at pictures of feet 👁👄👁 I especially like the pictures with extra fungi 😊💕❤️😘✨🧚\u200D♀️🌟 not only were there NO FEET PICTURES but this app made me really ✨uncomfy✨ because all the app had was stuff about politics. Now not to sounds like a middle aged mom living in Nebraska with 5 children no husband and an extreme obsession with coffee and calling the manager but.... I would like to know who’s in charge so I can give them a run for there money 🤩 anyway peace out my homies 😝","title":"No foot pics 😭","rating":1,"userName":"mayah the bee"}},{"id":"6174546451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:52:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"According to all known laws\n\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

If you are a well adjusted human, then I strongly advice against.   This app appears to have many bugs, including a virus it cannot manage effectively. Installing face mask 1.0 did not work, only made hillbilly bugs worse.  App came with very small penis, which was ineffective.  Other apps are not perfect, but this one has so many faults it’s hard to justify it still being available. I’ll take murder hornets instead.","title":"Tromp 2020 - do not f’ing recommend","rating":1,"userName":"code lsslskd"}},{"id":"6174508897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:42:16Z","isEdited":false,"review":"No for some reason everybody is reviewing the this is the weirdest I have no lie not trying to be mean but people keep saying it’s so weird that it should be gone people are saying that Trump is doing this thing where he’s going to ban TikTok and it’s dumb because it helps a lot of peoples problems people keep saying there’s weird pictures weird sentences and a lot more weird stuff and they say there’s disgusting stuff on there so I might as well not trying to be mean but I’m gonna rate this a one 😬 sorry I just believe the reviewer’s","title":"No","rating":1,"userName":"Allisonnohater"}},{"id":"6174505060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:41:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i started off by opening the app AND U WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT IT DID. my dog bartholomew TURNED ORANGE and started continuously barking TRUMP 2020🤢💩 MY DOG IS NOW POSESSED THANKS TO THE DOING OF THIS HORRIBLE APP.  anyways stream monster by irene and seulgi😘💅🏼\n  \n내 움직임은 특이해 \n평범치 않아 \n1 2 5 to 7 \n난 어둠 속의 Dancer \n온몸 뚝뚝 꺾어 \n침대 가까이 갈게 \n무시무시하게 \n네 심장을 훔쳐 지배해 \n\n하나의 조명 왜 그림자는 둘이야? \n내 속에 다른 게 눈을 뜬 것 같아\n\nI’m a little monster 날 겁내 \n널 괴롭혀 내 꿈만 꾸게 해 \n난 춤 추고 놀래 가위눌린 너의 \n그 몸 위에 주문을 걸면 \n\nI’m a little monster \nI’m a little monster \n\n차가운 땅 \n잿더미에서 일어났어 \n황혼에서 새벽 \n난 여전히 존재해 \n이 광기가 싫지 않아 \n즐기고 있는 걸 \n넌 벗어날 수 없어 \n도망가지를 마 다쳐 \n너를 구원하고 도로 약 올리고 \nOh 난 완벽하고 다시 엉망인 걸\n\nI’m a little monster 날 겁내 \n널 괴롭혀 내 꿈만 꾸게 해 \n난 춤 추고 놀래 가위눌린 너의 \n그 몸 위에 주문을 걸면 \n\nI’m a little monster \nI’m a little monster \n\n봐 난 그냥 놀고 있어\n\n나쁜 의도 없어 \n작지만 위험한 날 \n누가 거부하겠어 \n빨간 동이 틀 시간이야 \n이제 안심한 넌 \n꿈에서 나오려 해 \nBut monster lives forever \n\nI’m a little monster 날 겁내 \n널 괴롭혀 내 꿈만 꾸게 해\n\n난 춤 추고 놀래 가위눌린 너의 \n그 몸 위에 주문을 걸면 \n\nI’m a little monster \nI’m a little monster \nI’m a little monster","title":"⚠️WARNING⚠️ DO NOT DOWNLOAD‼️","rating":1,"userName":"SeaSeren"}},{"id":"6174504761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:41:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First off, as soon as i opened the app, a picture came up of a fascist, racist, cheeto that i’ve never seen before. If that wasn’t bad enough, it soon started invading my phone. I would wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, and hear whispers coming from my phone saying, “It’s gonna be YUGE” which i don’t even understand; huge has an h not a y. I then picked up my phone and every app and folder was replaced by this app. I had to burn my phone and throw it in the ocean to get it to stop.

Either way this app represents bigotry, hate, violence, fascism, homophobia, xenophobia, racism, and so many more horrible things and I think it’s just best that this app stay off the App Store and out of impressionable teens sights!! \n\nLove,\n\nAnother TikTok Teen 💞","title":"Absolutely Disgusting!!","rating":1,"userName":"Rachel26401"}},{"id":"6174358553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:57:17Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is a awful use of space I don’t think anyone care enough to use it.
