My wifi is top notch in my house but as soon as i downloaded it everything just started loading and loading for like a minute or two, and that is a minute or two too long. then my family started to notice their wifi on their phones being slow too and it ALL started when i downloaded this app. what a shame because i really just wanted to download it to be a great american in the oh so fee country that definitely does oppress people and gives us our right all because we totally do not have a bad president. definitely will be deleting and am so disappointed but i’m not surprised.","userName":"100% Truth For Sure","date":"2020-07-10T04:41:11Z","title":"HORRIBLE DONT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6179470278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app is so trash. i don’t even no why apple allows it to be on here.","userName":"MackMack47","date":"2020-07-10T04:41:10Z","title":"Worst app on here"}},{"id":"6179470206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app took 420 days to download. 69 days after my birth it finally downloaded. When I opened the app it took all my information and sent it to serial killers they just killed my 69 year old dog😭. Then the app started playing porn and I couldn’t stop it, it wouldn’t let me out of the app until the video was finished. I am traumatized. My 365 month old is also traumatized. Oh I forgot to say that they hacked into my microwave and started playing 365 days (the boat scene doe😳) anyways, I am traumatized and scared for my life. They also hacked into my computer and it won’t stop playing that foreigner song it’s been going off for 69 hours now and it’s getting annoying.
