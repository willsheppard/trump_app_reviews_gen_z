The president can’t afford to get an app that works he can’t afford to run the country. The care he puts into something like this made for the people who support him and it doesn’t even work shows he won’t care about us and the country.","title":"I’m severely disappointed","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jazzy jake C","rating":1}},{"id":"6179872594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:05:36Z","review":"Tremendously bad.

So I downloaded this app to help me get some Cheetos but there is nothing that talks about Cheetos! It is just vot-an things and rall-aes. Now I don’t know what those are but I am sure that doesn’t get me my Cheetos so please fix the app where it can provide me with the necessary Cheetos I need to get through my day.

The flashing lights included in the app could trigger seizures. The chanting voices in the background could scare children. Image quality is quite poor. Design is difficult to navigate. It was weird that they had a photo of the babadook in there. Does not do a good job at all. Subpar app.","title":"Extremely poor quality app","isEdited":false,"userName":"dannydevito21","rating":1}}]}
