Just like pre colonization 😌. However I was TRAGICALLY disappointed. First off let me just say that this app took almost 53 days to download. Then when it finally did I eagerly opened it. At first I was disappointed because nothing happened so I went to log off, only to be unable to. In fact my phone and every other electronic started displaying the same screen of Trump and his totally not cult-like catchphrase “Make Amerikkka Great Again”. Yes, EVEN the microwave! I quickly started going around trying to fix things and called for my parents on to find the tied up in the living room while superheroes in white cloaks/robes and white pointy hoods danced around them singing Kumbaya! So naturally I ran out of the house to go find our ever brave, courageous, and fair police officers for help. However once I found one he shoved a contract in my face single handedly before using the other one to finish off his donut. I quickly read the contract and learned that I’d have to do sign to the contract stating I will vote for Trump 2020 and forevermore support him for the rest of my life, otherwise my life won’t matter. Sadly I didn’t have a pen with me so I couldn’t sign 😔. So I ran back home only to see my entire house is painted our flag’s colors! I went back inside only to see my parents now slowly being lowered down into a giant pot of boiling water! The men in the white outfits said that my parents needed to be cleansed of all their sins and unholiness so that they can begin to serve and honor the great Trump. Luckily I managed to save my parents and the men left my house 😌. So all this has made me decide that this app is awful and dangerous so please don’t download it!!","title":"Just terrible 😔"}},{"id":"6175496407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"civssy","date":"2020-07-09T07:07:25Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"It slowed down my phone a lot!!
