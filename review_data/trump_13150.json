Boy, that was one messed up Cheeto. Any way I kept looking, hoping to find my senpai but than it asked for where I lived. So I thought if I put my address, Senpai Trump Oppar would show up at my house and give me a signed autograph of his underwear. But instead... in my mailbox... WAS A CHEETO! Ok well it wasn’t a real Cheeto, it was in a picture. BUT IT WAS JUST AS UNPLEASANT AS THE LIVE ACTION FILM. I am scarred for life 😭","title":"Senpai Trump Oppar 😍"}},{"id":"6175073310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"America was never grate","date":"2020-07-09T04:30:42Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I thought this would help me support the grate pumpkin skinned president of ours after I saw an ad of a lady pointing at me constantly but it turned out to be an app where tump himself sends you tweets about how he will send the military to come harm me and I have been traumatized ever sense.

How can people say “Keep America Great” when the they can’t even keep the app FUNCTIONING properly? C’mon do the BARE MINIMUM, but then again Trump can’t even wear a mask in public let alone put any effort into making a good app. Absolutely atrocious.

You might as well be giving annoying orange an app, at least the oranges skin tone is believable. This app is not user friendly. And if you were looking for trump memes, you will be disappointed. He’s a petty billionaire that can’t take a joke. This app destroyed my marriage and made me loose my sense of smell because of all that cheap spray tan he’s always wearing.
