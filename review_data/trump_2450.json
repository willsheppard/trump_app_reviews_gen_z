I am in generation z, and I am a white Christian conservative man that only believes what my family tells me and doesn’t do research for myself. I came into this app to support my president, but when I signed into the app I was bombarded with requests to sign my presidents birthday card. Obviously I have already signed so I kept on clicking no. Then I went to walk my turtle on a racetrack but when I went to cross the street a huge bus that said all lives matter and had the confederate flag and a statue of Christopher Columbus RAN OVER MY TURTLE. I went to my church to possibly pray for it to come back alive ya know like a zombie. But that didn’t work so I called trump himself and he told me since it was resisting and had a criminal record it deserved to die. DO NOT GET THIS APP. I don’t want anymore turtles to die🥺🥺🥺.","title":"not for gen z","rating":1,"userName":"jeff💅😌😗🤩"}},{"id":"6172898796","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:29:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the truest bane of human life as we know it. I’ve never been scared as I was using this app! I downloaded it in a vain attempt to further understand those who voted for our disgraceful president and I am in even more despair than I was previously. I opened the app the first time and was met with glitches and bugs immediately that would not allow me past the very first screen of the app. I hardly got past registering an account before it crashed once again, shattering my hopes and dreams for our country. My families future has been broken beyond repair and I’ll never forgive this app for the was it has torn us all apart. To support trump is to support the fact that half of my family is dead, and I soon will be too if trump wins. Sorry. Goodbye.","title":"I’ve never been so scared.","rating":1,"userName":"Catra Meowmeow"}},{"id":"6172898255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:29:41Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Besides my own personal political beliefs this app is filled with propaganda and protests the president in a false light. When Donald J Trump exclaimed that climate change was a “Chinese hoax” my respect diminished to his neglect of science. Although there was little to no respect to begging with. This man is a danger to our country, he has shown he is in support of white supremacy  and defending their actions. Trump is not a democratic president, he is in fact a fascist a dictator. Power hungry for more control. In the 2018 election we were able to retake the House and have elected Democrats willing to fight for a basic human rights. In 2016 Trump by attaining foreign power won the election. Also the electoral college is useless but that’s another discussion for another day. But yeah this app is terrible. Many glitches, constant maintainer breaks, and it slows down my phone.","title":"Poo","rating":1,"userName":"Joseph Biden"}},{"id":"6172866072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:19:55Z","isEdited":false,"review":"For one Trump is not a good president. I have seen one comment saying that they support trump and this app but they have not seen what he is doing to the country. I bet they are even a white Christian person who is not a different race or apart of the lgbtq+ community. Donald Trump only wants to make amercia great again for white straight Christians. There is actual proof of him making fun of George Floyd’s death and other racist actions. He does not want lgbtq+ people to join the army. These are only a few examples and im sure you can find more easily. If you are black or lgbtq+ and still support Trump that is basically saying you are a tree and support the process of cuting down trees for factories and other buildings. Do not just trust Fox news. See what is actually going on the world and do some research.","title":"Not a good app to use.","rating":1,"userName":"autumnnn 💞"}},{"id":"6172805647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:02:14Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened the app it took me to a picture of the Cheeto that is currently sitting in the white house and no cap🧢🧢🧢 my screen shattered and the phone started burning up to the point where my phone case started melting to my phone the app also sold my phone number to telemarketers and my phone has been going off every 5 minutes and that is not helping the temperature of my phone. In addition to that, just looking at president Cheeto, i was temporarily blinded so I couldn’t see at all for a week and I still haven't completely gotten my sight back and the doctors said I may never get my sight 100% back. If you really want to support this Cheeto, beware that it could cost you your sight and you precious phone. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!","title":"Almost fried my phone and blinded me","rating":1,"userName":"blinded sally"}},{"id":"6172550571","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:50:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I downloaded the app it asked for my number so I put it in. As soon as I did that my phone was immediately spammed with random messages non-stop. Not only did the app spam my phone random messages, but it also sent messages to everyone in my contact list. My managers from work was really upset about that. After a while the app froze my phone and so I was stuck with a background of Trump for days, unable to close my screen, go into other apps, or make phone calls. I even tried to get my phone fixed, but no one could do anything about it. Eventually i just bought a new phone so thanks a lot for making me spend money on another I didn’t need. I really do not recommend downloading this dumb app. It will break your phone.","title":"THE WORST APP EVER❤️","rating":1,"userName":"Rehhaithf"}},{"id":"6172506615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:37:54Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So I got the app a few days ago just so I could stay informed. This app took a whole day to install but I wasn’t too worried since my WiFi is not the best. So once it installed I decided to open the app but it just crashed right away. I opened the app again but it turned out to be a portal in another dimension. It was terrible, in this other dimension Trump was re elected and became a dictator. I had to go on this adventure to make it to Trump tower where the orange man was. I then had to defeat him. It was the only way I could make it out of the terrible dystopian dimension. One I defeated the orange carrot man I was brought back to our dimension, barely but I made it back. I don’t recommend this app if you are trying to live and not be almost killed by the carrot man. I am scared for life.","title":"My experience","rating":1,"userName":":{} :/ ;[]"}},{"id":"6177663819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:59:21Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I wouldn’t reinstall this app even if it was a matter of life or death. It was absolutely terrible! I get the app in order to keep track of the trump administration and see what trumps plans were if he were to be elected president in 2020. I expected a high dollar state of the art app to come from this aMaZiNg man. Instead I got a cheap app that doesn’t even remotely fit the app description. If that weren’t worse enough my phone started glitching the weeks after I installed it. It started with small things like dying on 20% but now I’ve started to get scammers and hackers. Random pictures are popping up in my camera roll and random events in my calendar. The app gave me a virus! I highly recommend you not installing this app! It was absolutely terrible!","title":"Hated It","rating":1,"userName":"JAydEn Pepper"}},{"id":"6177463036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:56:15Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I was excited to use this app because the description really grabbed my attention. However, the second I opened the app, I was required to enter my phone number. I entered my number a total of 23 (!) times and each of these times i was DECLINED! It kept saying my number was “invalid”. I decided to check the terms of service to figure out what was going on, but I couldn’t get through one sentence without the app crashing! This happened every time I opened it. My phone was also burning up from all the energy this app must have been using. I managed to struggle through about three sentences before I said enough was enough and deleted the app. This app needs serious adjustments before I will be downloading it again.","title":"So frustrating.","rating":1,"userName":"Karen Jensen Smith"}}]}
