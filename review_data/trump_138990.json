But when it finally downloaded, it came to life and attacked my pet squirrel. Not only did it do that but it also had a HUGE super bug that ruined that app and my entire phone. This is so frustrating and just makes me angry that it didn’t work. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYONE UNLESS IF YOU WANT TO CRY. 🤬🤬😱😟😳😟🤩😥😏😐😩😐🤫😟"}},{"id":"6179663215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"SO UNORGANIZED AND CONFUSING!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Ksmith874","date":"2020-07-10T05:46:57Z","review":"This app honestly is a mess, with unclear content and unhelpful information!

If he thinks that trying to block gen z and millennials from Tiktok is going to help him, he is sadly mistaken. I hope he reads and see these reviews too."}},{"id":"6179663109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"periyat!","date":"2020-07-10T05:46:55Z","review":"i downloaded this app and it took 69 minutes to download!!! the app isn’t even built well either ✋🙄. it hacked all of my personal info and started blasting 69 gooba on my phone!!
