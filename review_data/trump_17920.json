To start off, I had a whopping 8 inch penis, it was amazing because I am a top and my  husband loved it. But, as a week went by of using this app I noticed my penis started to shrink and by the end of the month my penis was 4 inches. Sadly, because of this app I had to buy dildo for my husband and I.","title":"Penis shrunk?","date":"2020-06-15T23:24:57Z","userName":"Pena Trait","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6056374867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app and immediately went blind. I can’t believe they managed to create a monster so ugly that it literally made my eyes explode. I am greatly disappointed that this app even exists and hope that no one else has to go through the horror of seeing His face.
