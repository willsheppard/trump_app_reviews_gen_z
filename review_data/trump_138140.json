They ruin everything! I was enjoying myself, happy knowing that I was more 5 times less likely to be incarcerated than someone with more melanin and I would always be treated much better by those around me because of my skin tone. Now, beautiful POC who have been oppressed for much longer than America has been a country are trying to get justice and it’s making me angy😠 How dare people think that they can make me less privileged by putting us on a level playing field?? It’s so not faaaiirrr😭😭 Now no one who has any sense of empathy, justice, etc respects me😤😭💔","userName":"Launa from launaw.com","title":"ZERO STARS😡😡"}},{"id":"6179785327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:32:44Z","review":"the second I downloaded the app my phone started to glitch and a Cheeto puff started to appear on my screen now my phone is ruined...
