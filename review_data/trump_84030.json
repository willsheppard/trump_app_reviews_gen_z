First of all not only did it take almost a year to finish downloading, but when it did download, I couldn’t even open the app. After a while after keeping the app, I got an alert that Elmo was going to be kidnapped if I didn’t feed my fish in time. I thought this was very confusing, so I fed my fish anyway. But apparently there was nuclear waste implanted into my fish food pellets that turned my goldfish into a bunch of Jimmy's moms. A day later I got a letter in the mail saying that Sid the science kid was going to pay a visit to my house which I thought was fine cuz I haven’t seen him for a while so I just kept the note and smiled. Until i found out it was really elmos kidnapper in disguise who was going to take jimmys moms too! I took a glance at the ground and found a little yellow orb that fell from the kidnappers pocket and accidentally dropped it on my dog. But little did I know that that orb was really magical and turned my dog into Clifford! Finally we could put an end to all this nonsense. Cliffords paw slammed on the ground killing the kidnapper and his friends. “Hooray!” We all called out. But apparently yelling that wasn’t a good idea, because we accidentally summoned a demon who threw a lightning bolt that ricocheted off the sky, hitting my house and bursting it into flames. But all was okay because luckily my neighbor knew aqua man who came over and splashed my house with a huge wave of water. Aqua man knew a place we could hide from the demon so we rode Clifford my big red dog to a cave located on mars. To this day aqua man and I are still stuck out on mars hiding from the demon. It’s sad that I’ll likely never see my family or friends again but I guess that’s fine. All in all we all know this whole incident was caused by having this app. So if you see this review, please PLEASE reconsider downloading as it could be catastrophic. Stay safe! 🧚✨🌸✨💕","userName":"sunsun13","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!","date":"2020-07-09T18:36:12Z"}},{"id":"6177755370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Don't do it","userName":"yurrrrrrrelizabeth","title":"Delete TikTok and I will get your app deleted nobody wants TikTok deleted","date":"2020-07-09T18:27:19Z"}}]}
