I had to go to a phone repair shop to get it fixed & while I was there, my daughter got hit by a car & I was not there to save her. This app caused me to lose my first born!

And people say how fast this loads smh. Then once it FINALLY loaded, I was introduced with so many ads. I couldn’t take it. Then once there was break from all those stupid ads, it crashed.

WASTE! Such a shame we definitely deserve better. Also does not respect my dark theme on phone which makes me suspect the app is STEALING DATA where it shouldn’t!

Actually, this app serves as a VERY ACCURATE representation of our dear Mr. President in that it is impossible to understand how the d*mn thing functions. It took years to download and when it finally did, it kept crashing!!! This guy can’t even get an app to work properly, much less an entire country!!!","userName":"bridgetdouglas1998","isEdited":false,"title":"GARBAGE LIKE THE MAN HIMSELF"}},{"id":"6175694466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:19:55Z","rating":1,"review":"You would think an app made for the President would be good. My 13 year old brother can develop an app better than this garbage. The performance of the application is terrible and there are plenty of bugs. The app also steals the data from your phone for the developers own personal gain","userName":"instalover2546","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6175676493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:13:52Z","rating":1,"review":"I was SO excited for this app but it took a MONTH to download, and once I could FINALLY open it the app was nothing but pictures of Trump’s tiny orange chub!!! VERY INAPPROPRIATE and UNCHRISTIAN 😡 I don’t know what libtard made this app, but MY President would NEVER have their privates exposed for children to see because he is a man of GOD ✝️😇 until this app gets fixed to show the REAL President, I’m uninstalling 😤","userName":"Barbara Job","isEdited":false,"title":"VERY UNCHRISTIAN!!!"}}]}
