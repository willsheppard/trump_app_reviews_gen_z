But, when I opened the app for the first time, I immediately vomited all over my room. At first I just thought I had eaten something bad, so I cleaned myself up, drank some water, and laid down on my couch. Then, I proceeded to open the app again, and I vomited all over my couch. This happened a couple more times, and it got to the point where I had to be taken to the hospital because I was so weak. When I got there, I told the doctors what I had been doing when I was throwing up, and they told me that I wasn’t the first patient they had that had fallen physically ill immediately after downloading and opening the trump app. It turns out, that America’s favorite cheeto puff is so gross and unbearable, that any direct contact with anything that has direct links to him can make you experience many symptoms of illness. If you download this app, do so at your own risk. I highly recommend not doing so.","title":"Made me physically sick","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ruxora01","date":"2020-07-08T20:27:40Z"}},{"id":"6173610949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"first of all when i downloaded the app my phone projectile vomited all over me and blew up 😳 i was infuriated and had to buy a whole new phone and that app STILL wasn’t downloaded😡 i had to wait 2 more years and got sick because every day my skin got more and more orange like the man in office😱 i was shocked to find out that my hair was falling out too and don’t get me started on my brain😣 i started to loose basic logic skills like if i had 3 apples and didn’t count them then that means there are no apples😢 so that mean that i can’t even go to work anymore😖😖 i am homeless living in the dumpster behind the trump hotel and they keep telling he to go back over the wall😔 i feel discriminated against😫 so now i have a samsung with .1 gigabytes and i eat pieces of the trump hotel for lunch and if i get lucky i get a piece of trumps hair too🤪🤪 in conclusion don’t download this app or you will be a 70 year old man living in a dumpster with no wifi and living off of concrete and gravel 🥺 OH AND DONT LET ME FORGET when i downloaded the app i was greeted by orange peels telling me to put Lysol in my veins to get rid of corona😔😔.","title":"dear beloved cheeto🥰🦋✨✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"daddy Tierra","date":"2020-07-08T20:24:15Z"}},{"id":"6177447943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Horrible app don’t recommend when I first download the app I thought hmmmm it would be good but then a Tasmanian devil came out of my phone and started to destroy my whole house I tried to get it out or put it back in the phone but it wouldn’t and only started to say racial slurs and things of that nature. Then and only then did the great orange master appeared on my phone and told me to vote for the wiz for 2020. Me (being the person I am) knowingly knowing I’m going to vote for the wiz went to click the vote button but then Beyoncé got in my way cause Jay Z wouldn’t make her lemonade then she made a whole song about it while blue ivy just walked around high on what ever kinda candy she was getting into. The great orange then told Taz (Tasmanian devil) to attack Beyoncé!! But jay Z finally came with the lemonade and threw it at Taz while blue ivy started to beat him with a stick made of a candy Cain. Taz then melted and ruined my phone so I have to walk all the way to Walmart to get a flip phone and share this story with you. That’s why I don’t not recommend this app....it will force you to by a flip phone that you don’t want.","title":"Phone less","isEdited":false,"userName":"Vote the Wiz!","date":"2020-07-09T16:51:40Z"}},{"id":"6176767151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I clicked download, I noticed bizarre things happening to my phone. My phone STRUGGLED to even turn on, moreover when I would go to even open this app it would take multiple tries to even access information as the app kept glitching out and turning off my phone. The following week I noticed EVEN MORE things occurring to my phone, I am truly disgusted and bewildered by the fact that our president cannot make an app that even works to begin with. I STARTED NOTICING FRAUDULENT CHARGES IN MY BANK ACCOUNT THAT HAVE SINCE BEEN TRACED BACK TO RUSSIAN HACKERS!!! All my data has been stolen from me and I am now in the process to CLOSING ALL MY ACCOUNTS and making new ones. Even so I still suspect that I will be a victim to these horrible crimes of hacking. I WILL NOT STAND FOR THESE INJUSTICES!!! I have been robbed of my own information which is something that I should never have to worry about as an American citizen. Additionally I have tried to reach out to the team managing this app to inform them of my MANY issues, However, I have NOT gotten a single reply from them. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I was reading my bible, when all of a sudden I see an orange on my phone! I was confused as to what this thing was, because I was positive I left those downstairs. When I go downstairs to check, I see nothing. I start laughing because I forget that I’ve never really seen him (trump) in his true form. So I do the thing they do on tiktok with the laugh and rub your chin in remembering all the good times I’ve had on an app he’s seeking to demolish. Then I quickly deleted this God forsaken app called “trump 2020???” because this man needs Jesus? holy water? the bible? idk he needs SOMETHING. Also!!! To anyone reading this who is Christian, like me,🥺 please watch the documentary “American Gospel”!!!Or even if you’re not Christian, it’s such a good explanation of the true gospel that has been twisted, and made to please man rather than God!! I love everyone!! (Even trumpet....although I hate what he dose....RACIST... narcissistic...RAPING....women hating....orange looking pineapple square!! Seriously GET THIS MAN OUT OF OFFICE...and the only reason I love you is because we are called to love everyone by God) ALSO IF QUARANTINE IS MAKING YOU A LITTLE FAT BE MY FRIEND??? No?? Ok.

Boy was I in for a wild ride. The first time I opened the app, a notification from Donald Trump himself popped up, telling me that I needed to surrender the keys to my 2009 Honda Accord immediately or else physical harm would come upon my son. Terrified for his safety, I mailed said keys directly to the White House less than 20 minutes later. I checked into the app daily to see if this issue was resolved, but ever time I logged on, more members of the Trump extended family requested more of my personal items in exchange for my son’s safety. In fact, Donald J. Trump Jr. asked for the most absurd item of them all. DJTJ was bold enough to ask for a 24oz Tupperware container of O negative blood!!!!!! How could I even do this when I have AB?!?!?! I finally decided to pull the plug on this app yesterday and delete it off my Samsung Galaxy smartphone. I have decided to cut off all communication to the outside world and spend the next 4 months in a hidden bunker with my son to protect ourselves, only to come out of hiding on November 3rd to vote Trump OUT!!!!","title":"This app almost killed my son","isEdited":false,"userName":"getmoneyswagyolo$$$$","date":"2020-07-09T02:37:55Z"}}]}
