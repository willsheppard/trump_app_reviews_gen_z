So as I’m sitting there waiting for the app to download and thinking about the amount of white supremacist BS I’m about to witness, my beloved dog looked over my lap and noticed what I’m doing. Now, my dog is a huge BLM supporter and when he saw that I, ME, was downloading this retched app, he jumped off the couch, opened the front door, and ran into oncoming traffic. Luckily he survived and I got him inside safely, but I do not appreciate the mental stress this app has caused my family pet. Donald Trump is a White Supremacist.","userName":"Penny1970","date":"2020-07-08T21:10:23Z","title":"0 stars","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173734305","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and it took a whole month and I was so excited. Right as I opened the app a huge face of Mr. President popped up and for some reason when I showed my friend she fainted!!! And then I showed the picture to other people and everyone fainted!! I called the service of the app and all I could hear was someone pooping and farting. It was horrible and once my friends had woken up they said it was horrible when they fainted. I wanted this app just to learn more about the life of an orange but it didn’t work out. Very disappointed.","userName":"uglyrasicttrumpcheeto","date":"2020-07-08T21:08:47Z","title":"horrible","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173729355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I wish I could leave zero stars.. I downloaded the app because I wanted to support MY president, despite his homophobic, sexist, and racist tendencies. As soon as I opened the app, a picture of a terribly deformed oompa loompa showed up and It frightened me so bad I passed out and hit my head on the counter. I had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance and I was in the hospital for four days getting treated for a head injury. Now I have an enormous medical bill and since we don’t have universal healthcare I have to pay this all myself!! Donald Trump you owe me!! Terrible app do not get!!","userName":"drowning in debt","date":"2020-07-08T21:06:55Z","title":"Terrifying","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173641040","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. The first problem I came across was that it took almost an hour to download while all of my other apps have downloaded in under a minute. After it finally downloaded I got an alert that my phone was almost out of storage. The app took up five gigabytes of storage. The app also somehow accessed my debit card information and charged me 250 dollars even though I never made a purchase. In conclusion I hate this app and make sure to vote for Joe Biden instead of this racist cheeto✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️❤️","userName":"Melanief1313","date":"2020-07-08T20:35:00Z","title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173613091","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"First off it took 6 hours to download and it was glitching very badly it overall just needs a new update. When i entered the app it wouldn’t let me touch my screen. When I tried to put my mobile number in it just took me out of the app. Then when i tried to login it said that’s my email was fake and wouldn’t let me login. Then when i tried to contact them about it they just told me to stop emailing them. While I was logging in it just took me out and the app took me to SUBWAY SURFERS. I WILL be contacting corporate about this.","userName":"ليعيزينربع","date":"2020-07-08T20:25:03Z","title":"TERRIBLE APP😤","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173606855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"very disappointing. i was looking to support my racist, misogynistic, homophobic, sexist, white supremacist, fascist of a president, but it just brought me to a screen of a scary cheeto in human form. very disappointed in this app because it was very orange and i was quite frightened. i also reserved many tickets to cheeto man’s upcoming rally but my pasta pan is very at risk to COVID-19 and i wouldn’t want to infect her. too bad. i was really looking forward to it. i hope everyone else has a great time at the rally tho. GEN Z- please don’t forget to reserve your tickets. love you cheeto man hope you lose the election😘","userName":"eww this app🤮","date":"2020-07-08T20:22:48Z","title":"cheeto app😔","isEdited":false}}]}
