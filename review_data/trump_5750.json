I can’t believe that this scared my cat. My cat went flying across the room. Crusty looking of a person really offended my cat so bad. Now how am I supposed to help my cat. Such awful experience either way. Proceeding the app immediately got my information of where I was located. Than classified false information with a bunch of fake news. He is such a cry baby and isn’t matter. Somebody really needs to do something about it before he offers tan to become one of him. His crusty looking Cheeto really think he’s doing something but he’s not.","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible experience","date":"2020-07-09T07:48:32Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175031133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"check out joji from 88rising","review":"All eyes on me now\nIf you still doubt mine\nIt's too pointless\nWe're still young and wild\nWe gonna find new world to be mine\n지도가 부르는 곳 그 섬은 곧\n만인의 꿈이자 겁\n끝에 꿈꾸는 시작 날개를 펴고\n영원히 철없게 like Peter\n터질듯한 심장을 pump it up\n풀린듯한 주먹을 꽉 쥐어\n자 열린다 진실의 문, 그 앞에서\n부숴버릴 듯이 we on fire\n너는 여기서 멈출 텐가\n그토록 원하던 것이 여기에 oh\n다시 돌아올 수 없어도\nOh, we must going on\n가자 eh oh eh oh eh\n가자\n끝이 기다리는 시작으로\nOn my my way 모두 발을 맞추고\nOn my my way 하나 둘 하면 뛰어\nOn my my way 없는 길도 만들어\n어서 가자 어서 가자\n끝이 기다리는 시작으로\nReady now for next journey\n숨 참고 달려 내가 달려가는 get money\nI got a win 더 외쳐대\nAcre보다 크게 쳐버리는 탬버린\n잭 스패로우보다 높이\n가라고 나 가라고 난 흔들림 없이\n때려 bang bang 단번에 숨이\n마치 down with us, get it going\n터져버려도 상관없어 난\n지금 이곳은 끝의 시작\n자 열린다 진실의 문, 그 앞에서\n부숴버릴 듯이 we on fire\n너는 여기서 멈출 텐가\n그토록 원하던 것이 눈앞에 oh\n다시 돌아올 수 없어도\nOh, we must going on\n가자 eh oh eh oh eh\n가자\n끝이 기다리는 시작으로\nOn my my way 모두 발을 맞추고\nOn my my way 하나 둘 하면 뛰어\nOn my my way 없는 길도 만들어\n어서 가자 어서 가자\n끝이 기다리는 시작으로\nBreaking the wall, oh oh (oh oh)\n누군가는 (누군가는)\n가야 할 곳 (가야 할 곳)\n쉽지만은 않더라도\n그 이유가 우린 맘에 들어\nEh eh eh eh eh 뛰어 뛰어\nEh eh eh eh eh 뛰어 뛰어\nEh eh eh eh eh 뛰어 뛰어\n어서 가자 어서 가자\n끝이 기다리는 시작으로\nOn my my way 모두 발을 맞추고\nOn my my way 하나 둘 하면 뛰어\nOn my my way 없는 길도 만들어\n어서 가자 어서 가자\n끝이 기다리는 시작으로\n가자","isEdited":false,"title":"😤😤😤","date":"2020-07-09T04:17:32Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174987253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Neodiddy","review":"I’m not a crazy political person, but in light of everything I wanted to see what both candidates were about, so I decided to get the app. Not only did is crash upon entry but it requires that I make an account and give person information to see anything. I’m sorry but no, I will not give in my phone number let alone anything else. Apologies Mr. Trump. Also the fact that this app is beating Twitter currently is kinda unrealistic so it doesn’t look good to those who are against Trump. It makes it seem like he paid for the spot rather than earning it.","isEdited":false,"title":"I sorry but no","date":"2020-07-09T04:03:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174952258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚🏼💞🙈","review":"my phone was working just fine before i got this app, but less then a minute after i downloaded it my phone started glitching really bad and EXPLODED IN MY HAND! i was rushed to the emergency room, but the damage to my hand was so bad i had to get it amputated. i am currently typing this with my only remaining hand. there was nothing wrong before, so i can only guess that it was because i downloaded this app. overall this app is just as trash as our president, and will destroy your phone (or your hand) just like trump did to this country, DONT DOWNLOAD IT! 😽 #settleforbiden2020","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS TRASH","date":"2020-07-09T03:52:32Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174949424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TR1106","review":"While I was walking my pet duck, I realized this app sucked. 😵🎂😞🥳🤦🏼\u200D♀️💐🙁🥳😭🤬🙁🎁🎉 I was so disappointed but then suddenly I got a text from trump. I knew it was him because all the words were spelled wrong and it made no sense.  He told me covfefe would cure corona virus if I injected it into me. I wasn’t sure I should believe him and figured he was up to his old tricks!  Darn you, you orange faced Cheeto lookin’ diaper wearing baby. Needless to say, I blocked his number.
