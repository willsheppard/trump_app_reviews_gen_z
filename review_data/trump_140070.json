I was so excited as I sit here waiting for the app to download. But it took hours! The wait was just tremendous and I waited for billions and billions of days. FINALLY I got the app but it wanted my phone number?? Like WHAT kind of propaganda and exploitation I this? That wasn’t even the worst part!! I started to notice the app’s influence infiltrating my life a little more everyday. I noticed the paint on the walls becoming a little more orange and my poor dog’s hair turned orange and was balding!! When I woke up the next morning, my entire house and everything in it was orange. Appalled, I immediately deleted the app hoping to reverse the new damage. However, it’s gonna take some serious BLUE influence to reverse this. If anyone has experienced the same trauma due to this app please reach out as there are grounds for a class action law suit to get our billions and billions.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:05:47Z"}},{"id":"6179543836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😍 Chlami diea 😍","title":"I no longer support trump because of this app","rating":1,"review":"This app is very unacceptable.
