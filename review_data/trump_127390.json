I was just trying to get a spot at the rally that j would indeed ‚ú®not‚ú® go to. Ayer I opened the app it took me 20 minutes to get into the part to fill in my information for the rally. After I got my ticket I deleted the app. After doing so I had already gotten 7 texts and 3 calls from random numbers. My phone usually doesn‚Äôt ever get texts or calls much less from random people. Every time it would be a different number. The next day the calls and texts were becoming more frequent. Then my phone started to crash. Now some people may say it‚Äôs because of the \ntype of phone I have but it definitely isn‚Äôt. I have the iPhone 11 Pro Max. And I just got it 2 months ago. I have had no other problems with this phone. I have never dropped the phone neither have I ever gotten it wet. It has a very protective case on it and it up to date. I‚Äôve never had these problems in any other phone I‚Äôve had either. The calls and texts throughout the days were progressively getting larger and longer. I ended up restarting my phone and loosing all my pictures and contacts. I would like all the other people using this app to be aware of the problems going on.

All the Karen‚Äôs and Chads that help create this app can go to hell. This app is not gonna empower nobody and all the airheads who say this app is not pathetic can kiss my black ass. You don‚Äôt have any idea why ppl of this generation are doing this. Absolutely clueless and uneducated by why everyone is so upset. Ppl who have this downloaded in their phone in hopes that in November he will win are narcissistic, racist and impulsive. It takes a lot to support him. Someone who doesn‚Äôt care for kids of all races and someone who only cares for himself. That‚Äôs not a president that‚Äôs a uneducated and privileged white man. Once again we have to repeat history with the cruel intentions of a dictator. In conclusion this app is terrible and I would not recommend to anyone of any sorts.
