The app keeps crashing, and now that I gave them my info, I’m getting contacted by a bunch of different republican candidates that I didn’t give my information to. I didn’t agree to that, and I’m furious.","date":"2020-07-09T15:58:31Z"}},{"id":"6177244349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"peppa😗","title":"TeRrIbLe🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Well this app promised me to get BTS concert tickets and all i got was an orange man speaking about how hell make America great again🥴 anyways i started reading more and more and i started to feel powerful like i had the right to objectify women and be racist to black people ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️ finding a solution i yeeted my phone across America hoping to would go knock some sense into out orange president but it sadly didnt☹️ anyways terrible app it belongs to the highway😌🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨","date":"2020-07-09T15:52:39Z"}},{"id":"6177223802","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Voll34ball","title":"Worst App (Do Not Recommend)","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to see what our amazing president had planned for the campaign. When I downloaded it, I was attacked through the screen by a giant Oompa Loompa. I could not even catch a break before being attacked on twitter by the creator himself.

I can’t use this ap for what I need. As the TikTok app is about to leave the App Store I started to look for new apps to spend my time on. I found this app to not help. I would like to say that the app falsely promotes information that is not true. I do not appreciate the language used in this app. I find it offensive to my personal beliefs. I understand the need for a new app to fill the void but it is no bueno","date":"2020-07-09T15:33:13Z"}}]}
