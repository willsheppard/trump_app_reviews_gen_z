I figured why not try it out. He didnt make america great the first four years he was elected but maybe if we give him four more he can finally do what he said he would back in 2016. After waiting a month fir it to download i owned the app to see a nazi on my screen. I screamed and threw my phone shattering the screen. I got my new phone and re-downloaded the app and as soon as i opened it my head started aching and my ears started ringing and i started having a seizure. Once i got to the doctor they ran a billion tests and told me i had brain cancer, and it was terminal. They said they will do further research and that i should look into my families history to see if its genetic. As i opened google on my phone i got a notification from the trump app saying that i should come reserve a ticket to his next rally. I had gotten tickets to his last rally but sadly i couldn't go because i had to walk my fish. As i open the app the room starts spinning and i loose my vision. I quickly turn off my phone and everything goes back to normal. I book an appointment and tell the doctor both time that i had medical problems i was opening the trump app. He instantly says,” i know your problem, you have too much of the faccistpig and racism hormone its causing you brain cancer, delete the app and it should go away shortly.” I deleted the app and the brain cancer went away, tumor and all. I am currently working on a lawsuit just like stormy Daniels, hoping to get some cash from my trauma caused by this app.Do NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"title":"This app gave me brain cancer.","date":"2020-07-09T18:55:23Z","userName":"alaskaiswhereilive"}},{"id":"6177846672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I dont want trump to be president ever he is horrible and he is banning tik tok he's mad that we made him go into hiding so now gen z is gonna make it more worse no one wants him as president he can smd","rating":1,"title":"Bad president","date":"2020-07-09T18:54:37Z","userName":"babyashleysingh"}},{"id":"6177846503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Cat on the hat on Donald trumps face and he told me he would never do that again because he was actually joking about life and he was actually an orange , and the real president was Obama.This app is bad, don’t believe Donald trump he will take your orange.

Think about it minorities all over the world are struggling; Blacks, Hispanics, Indians, Africans, Muslims, LGBTQ+ members, Asians, even women, and so many more are struggling right now just because you thought it was a good idea to only focus your attention on the majority. Well news flash to you NOT EVERYONE IS WHITE, A CIS MALE, AND STRAIGHT!!! You are taking away their rights for basic human needs! Especially during a pandemic!! Do you think it’s okay to take away the lgbtq+ members’ rights away?!?! What if they need to go to the hospital? By you simply allowing this to happen that makes it okay for doctors, nurses, and surgeons of all types to deny them medial attention because of their gender and/or sexual identity! Do you not see anything wrong with that!!! Do you not understand that minorities risk their life everyday just because of their skin color or how they identify? Do you understand that minorities don’t choose to be a minority but guess what we don’t care about how we identify ourselves or the color of our skin because we’re proud of who we are and that’s NEVER GOING TO CHANGE! You simply don’t understand! Why is it so hard for you to do that!?!?! DO YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO KINDERGARTEN!?!?! Because there they teach you to treat people how you want to be treated!! If you don’t want your rights, speech, family, or ANYTHING taken away then take a good look at what you are doing now! Literally you are taking all that away from people and more just because they are different from what is consider “normal”! This is wrong and what your doing to all of these minorities is disgusting! Once again if you didn’t understand me the first time...TREAT PEOPLE HOW YOU WANT TO BE TREATED!!! And if you still don’t understand it then that obviously means that we have a president who doesn’t understand one of the most basic human rules that they teach you in elementary school...anyways I can’t wait for election so we can vote your ass out! Thank you for listening 🦋💫💖🧚bye bunker boy!! Oh also (P.S I hope you read this carefully and by the way if your so worried about the people and wanting them on your side then....stop worrying and a stupid app and please worry about the well being of everyone in America because there are more people in the country besides white people! Get it right!)","rating":1,"title":"This is for you I hope you enjoy! 💕✨🧚\u200D♂️🍃","date":"2020-07-09T18:54:03Z","userName":"🌈Nickname🌈"}}]}
