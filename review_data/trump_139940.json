I’m sitting on the toilet trying to figure out what went so wrong on my life that I felt compelled to download the Donald trump app when secret service busted down my bathroom door. Apparently when a person of color downloads the app the secret service microchips them and puts a security detail on them as they feel we could be spies sent from the people who actually care about the lives and wellbeing of other people. They told me watch my step and if I make any wrong moves the microchip will blow up Suicide squad style"}},{"id":"6179557015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"The app doesn’t even work","date":"2020-07-10T05:10:08Z","userName":"lljmac","review":"The app downloads Radom stuff to your phone.

It tries to blame other apps for the unnecessary  memory storage that it requires."}}]}
