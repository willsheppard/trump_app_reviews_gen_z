It keeps crashing and it’s bad quality. I love Mr. Trump and all, but this app is 💩💩. This app definitely deserves to be removed at once. I can’t believe that I agree with gen z for once, but I do.","date":"2020-07-09T19:38:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"EMP11037","rating":1,"title":"Terrible!!

Also when I opened the app, a man dressed a fish rang my doorbell, punched me in the spleen and ran off with my wife, my sriracha sauce and my antique Swedish penis enlarger. 3.4/10, missing my spicy sauce but still waiting for that child pornography..","date":"2020-07-09T19:37:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"eat some vegetables","rating":1,"title":"Child pornography 🤭🤭😭"}},{"id":"6177946524","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is as dysfunctional as Donald Trump ans his administration. Doesn’t work like Donal Trump. I kept running into content issue where I kept reading alternative facts that seemed quite dangerous. I dont think Im supposed to inject lysol into my body because it can kill you, but Donald Trump said it may work. Im going to listen to the CDC.","date":"2020-07-09T19:26:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"TaeNavy","rating":1,"title":"App Dysfunctional"}},{"id":"6177930149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Downloaded. Opened. Glitches. Can’t do anything on the app. When i finally get it working after hours of trying, I mentally take damage from Trumps awful policies. This has affected me tremendously.

I don’t recommend this app.(ps. Plz get this man out of office if you keep him in office Amerikkka is going to go down hill. Also if you can’t tell I’m a gen z that doesn’t favor Donald trump.","date":"2020-07-09T19:08:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"F n vc deg m bc c","rating":1,"title":"Ari"}},{"id":"6177861923","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hi old trump “love your new app” Ik what u look like backed pota u better run befor I take off your fake WIG LIKE I LOVE YOUR LOVE ORNGR SKIN I NEED HELP WITH TAKE HIM OFF THE I HATE this app it took Hella long to download, when it did it took all my data and hacking my phone.

And that’s just aside from the horrible content the app is trying to spread to its users. If there was a “no stars” option I would have gone with that","date":"2020-07-09T18:41:40Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kat876123","rating":1,"title":"Poorly made"}},{"id":"6177763741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is app is the literal worst it’s always crashing it never wants to open.
