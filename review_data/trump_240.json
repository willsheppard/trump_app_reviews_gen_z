Ruined my phone.","review":"I wanted to download this app so I could see the other side of political arguments. However, i should have just stuck to google because first of all, this app took over 3 days to download. In the meantime, my phone was extremely glitchy and was constantly lagging. Every time I tried to enter the camera app, health app, or even calendar app, it would immediately shoot me back to the home screen. When the app finally downloaded, it didn‚Äôt even work! Whenever I tried to enter the application, my phone would either direct me back to the home screen or it would shut off completely. After nearly a week of trying to get into the app and putting up with the glitches it brought to my device, I finally decided to delete the application. And just as I thought it would, my phone went back to normal! There were no longer any glitches or lags. I tried to download the app again. This time, it only took two days to download, however the same thing happened. It ruined my whole phone and once I deleted it, my phone went back to normal. For your own good, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","isEdited":false,"userName":"!!!!!!!important!!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:27:25Z"}},{"id":"6173416347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dumpster Fire","review":"Trash app. Mr. trump you can do better. This app was so bad. It was always crashing, in fact I could barely keep the app open for more than about 30 seconds without it crashing (just like trump cannot say 30 words without sounding dumb). Second it took soooooo long to download, I mean it must‚Äôve taken about 45 minutes to download, and I had prioritized the download. Third, the content in the app is just plain rotten (just like trumps actions.). So rotten in fact it started to attract flies, and nobody wants flies as a part of their trump 2020 app experience. Fourth, this app shut down my phone (just like trump shuts down this country), it was so bad that my phone could not perform basic functions such as calling, texting, etc. without shutting down, I would go so far as to say that it installled malware on my phone (just like trump ‚Äúinstalled malware‚Äù into this country.) Fifth and finally his app had a horrible layout. I mean it was absolutely horrible (just like trumps leadership).  extremely counter intuitive. (Just like trumps actions). Well anyways thank you for taking your time to read this review. Moral of the story is DO NOT GET THIS APPPPP!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"jdkxoshdkdo","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:17:32Z"}},{"id":"6173212562","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"useless and disappointing app","review":"downloaded this app w HIGH hopes, such an unfortunate downfall for me. it wouldn‚Äôt let me open the app w out exiting to my home screen. it then glitched out my entire phone after i closed and redownloaded in attempts to fix it!! i couldn‚Äôt click ANYTHING anywhere!!!!! then my phone FELL from my hands (this app made it QUITE slippery you see-) and it SHATTERED.

When I first opened the app I saw the Cheeto and I got a temperature it was bad all the way up to 169 degrees and that wasn‚Äôt even at its worst at its worst my temperature was at 420 degrees the doctors said I should‚Äôve been dead. After about a week in the hospital I left and went home I went to delete the app and I accidentally clicked on open instead of delete that‚Äôs where it really got terrible. First I started coughing I immediately closed the app but again I clicked on open app instead of delete because I opened the app I started having trouble breathing and passed out I flatlined when I got to the hospital and I saw hell the devil said I was sent to hell for downloading the trump app. The doctors  revived me luckily and then tested me for COVID-19 and I tested positive. You may be thinking you could‚Äôve gotten COVID from something else and no I couldn‚Äôt have because I live alone and I haven‚Äôt left my house in 3 months I‚Äôve been surviving on my vegetable and fruit garden.

I hopped into my farmhouse and downloaded the app with my very fast 1000mg wifi to understand what all the bark was about. I was disappointed in what I saw. They were advertising a fat orange with with a small tiny little itty bitty deformed yellow stem ü§Æ. I love oranges, but something about this one was off. And I couldn't quite place it. So I went to talk to my pigs, they said you were a long lost relative of their ancestors and they‚Äôd love for you to come live with them in the mud. I went to talk to my chickens whom hide in the ‚Äòbunker‚Äô. They said they helped raise him, they taught you all about hiding in a bunker like a ‚ú®C H I C K E N‚ú®. They clearly didn't fail their duties. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been nice if they just accidentally dropped a particular orange from the top level? Anyways. I was very concerned with the information I got from the farm animals. I found it strange they advertised an orange for the app and J would like to report it. I plan on telling the penguins all about it tomorrow if the orange‚Äôs small stem doesn't haunt me through the night. Send me good-luck and prayers üôè","isEdited":false,"userName":"i live solitare","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:45:58Z"}},{"id":"6176931563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It‚Äôs a no for me ‚ù§Ô∏è","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache?

THIS APP BRAINWASHES DOGS!!","review":"I originally downloaded this app in the hopes of keeping up to date in the life of my favorite non-racist, non-misogynistic, caring, selfless POTUS üíïMr. Donald J (Genius) Trumpüíï. Little did I know this god forsaken app would take several weeks and almost all the available space on my phone in order to download properly. I have never experienced such a thing with other apps such as Facebook, Bumble, EHarmony, Pocket Bible, and Candy Crush üò°üò°. Immediately after opening the app I received a knock on my door followed by it being broken in. A dog wearing fake tan and a blonde wig with a Trump 2020 sign then proceeded to break into my house and eat my newborn grandson. It then handed me a note explaining how I was to vote for Trump in the coming election in November or my daughter and her other two children would be next. I never connected these two events until I further examined the app and saw the same dog on a status update by mr glorious supreme leader Donald Trump! I am convinced that our POTUS has enslaved several thousand dogs and forces them to campaign in his place while hiding out in Washington D.C. PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS APP UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ENSLAVEMENT OF DOGS FOR POLITICAL GAIN.","isEdited":false,"userName":"CandyCrushMom64920","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:23:13Z"}},{"id":"6175223966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! HIGH CHANCE OF KIDNAPPING!!","review":"i was told by some friends to get this app. i did, even though i honestly didn‚Äôt really want to. they told me that this app would give me a reason to like trump, the orange cheeto who kinda looks like shane dawson. kind of a weird person to be the president of my country, right? so anyways, i downloaded this app, and as soon as i opened it all i can see is the color orange!!! the american flag is orange, my room is orange, and most of all, the only foods in my fridge is oranges and cheetos! i was going to get some human meat from my fridge, but all i could see is oranges and cheetos! i am appalled. i decided these friends needed to be CUT OFF. but when i tried, they held me hostage and made me sing the national anthem and say ‚Äútrump 2020‚Äù until i couldn‚Äôt speak. i had to escape by deleting the app. everything went away, the cheetos and oranges in my fridge, i could see every color(including orange), and my friends weren‚Äôt crazy anymore. i think this app is a cult. and i do not recommend, as it caused me great damage. i now cannot look at the color orange without screaming with agony, and the words ‚Äútrump 2020‚Äù also make me scream with agony.
