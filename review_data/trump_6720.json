Let’s not forget to mention the fact that my phone was overheating during the downloading process. That was ridiculous i thought it was going to blow up. Honestly the worst app i’ve ever downloaded; if freezes, never loads i DO NOT RECOMMEND. In conclusion i think the creator of the app and everyone associated with it should                 \n✨🌟💙accidentally fall off a boat 🌈💞🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T13:27:14Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jezz.rivera_"}},{"id":"6176699927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"VERY BAD/UNSAFE","rating":1,"review":"You have to enter your phone number so there’s no way you can secretly support your favorite president of all time. AND, although I support the president’s presidential actions, he’s related to Epstein and I don’t want to be sexually trafficked. Once you know my number, you can trace my location and I think I’m pretty hot and don’t want to be taken away. I was going to give the app more stars but then I realized he was holding rallies during unsafe times, which means this app can encourage the spread of COVID-19. If you want an app that puts you in danger, it’s this one.","date":"2020-07-09T13:25:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Josephine Fetter"}},{"id":"6176618636","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"it’s uhh...it’s uhm...no❤️","rating":1,"review":"hi apple ppl this is liv uh yeah i just wanted to tell u that this app actually Set my house on FIRE🔥 crazy right? yeah it like hacked into my security System and started shouting absolute bs about how the country is great and that the president or whateva is qualified and not a xenophobic arse with itsy bitsy baby hands🤧i hope you are able to update this App, as in use it to hack into the administrations databases to fix these problems right at the source😂😂😂 please let me know if there is anything i can do to speed up the process of removing this Application thank you So much. ttyl💖","date":"2020-07-09T13:03:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"felixDOTcom"}},{"id":"6176553466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Extremely dissatisfied","rating":1,"review":"I had extremely high expectations for this app. Considering the president has done nothing to help the current corona virus crisis, I assumed he would have put some energy into this app...I was wrong. The app took weeks to download, and when it finally did it was extremely slow and kept crashing. It has continuously drained my battery and deleted my grinder app. I assumed since he has done nothing as president he would at least put some effort into his own app. I was wrong. Do not waste your time!!!","date":"2020-07-09T12:46:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"BLM💙"}},{"id":"6176284151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very undeveloped app","rating":1,"review":"It took 90% of my storage in my phone. Caused my phone’s battery to run out quickly and quite glitchy. I personally don’t like this app and in fact I full on hate it. The logo isn’t cute, the app doesn’t run efficiently, even though I’m at home near my wifi router to even load this app, drains your phone’s battery life faster, and finally again like I said it takes all of my phone’s storage. Where’s a 0 star option when you need it? Cause not even one star represents how bad this app truly is!","date":"2020-07-09T11:31:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"scarlettblazer"}},{"id":"6176003519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"review":"The majority of “information” on this app is extremely faulty. Quotes are taken out of context to manipulate their meaning. They try and justify their arguments by attacking their opponents arguments. All the “gifts” are problematic, sexist, racist, and way overpriced. Everything is extremely biased. Statements directly contradict each other. Do not use this app. If you want information regarding Trump and his campaign, read from a variety of sources, left leaning and right leaning and neutral. Read or listen to official statements from both Trump and Biden and formulate your own opinions. 0/10","date":"2020-07-09T10:03:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"AbbyRu"}},{"id":"6175926515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not download","rating":1,"review":"This is one of the worst apps I’ve ever downloaded onto my phone. When I first downloaded it, this cryptic message popped up on my phone and deleted all of the contacts on my phone. And in the middle of the night, the app would randomly open and spew random Donald Trump quotes and telling me to vote for Donald Trump 2020. Then next thing you know I’m in the hospital because I got hit by a flying shark. There is no doubt in my mind that this app caused that to happen. I would never download this app again. If I could give it negative stars I would.","date":"2020-07-09T09:38:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"no??!?!"}},{"id":"6175924394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"MY PHONE EXPLODED!","rating":1,"review":"wish i could give 0/5 stars. this app is terrible!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT! The app took 17 weeks to download and is very slow. it functions at the speed and quality of the original iphone. it is filled with taboo and fake news. my phone def got hacked and i was flooded with scam calls emails and pop up adds everywhere. porn l accounts hacked all my family devices and my 5 year old child was forced to see mia khalifa take two in the back door. as a mentally stable person; i would rather die than download this app again❤️","date":"2020-07-09T09:37:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"💅🧚\u200D♂️🧚🧚\u200D♀️❤️"}}]}
