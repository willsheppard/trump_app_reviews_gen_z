Once I opened the app I heard a knock on my door and it was a bunch of ummpa loompas they went inside and had a bunch of bags that were filled with flying Cheetos and once they opened the bags the Cheetos were flying around my house chanting “Trump For 2020”. After that I deleted the app but then I realized that the app deleted EVERYTHING. My photos, videos, my data EVERYTHING. Don’t get this app and DO NOT support this Cheeto (aka Donald Trump). Or else all of these horrible events and much more will happen to YOU!!! Stay safe from sexist, homophobic and racist Cheetos everyone!!!!🧚✨","title":"DONT GET THIS APP!!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Anonymous🧚✨"}},{"id":"6175690513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:18:36Z","review":"this app took weeks to download, so disappointing. then i got many inappropriate...explicit ads, i am beyond disgusted and think that there should be serious consequences for whoever was up to this. this app also gave my phone a virus and now im getting EXPLICIT ads popping up!! my 5 husbands and 9 girlfriends and wives are going to KILL me if they see them!! this may be unrelated but ever since i downloaded the app, i’ve been seeing this creepy man in the corner of my eye ever since. he haunts me. he will haunt you too if you download this app. highly don’t recommend!!!","title":"THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"userName":"ephemeralfrancesca"}},{"id":"6175645281","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:02:57Z","review":"When I downloaded this app and opened it for the first time I heard a knock on my door. I went to go answer it obviously and my dog followed me and when I opened the door, Mike Pence was standing there. He said “I know you have Barron.” I got really scared because I was harboring Barron in my closet. They could smell Pence’s scent and luckily they escaped out of my bedroom window. I miss them already 😥 But anyways Pence came into my house and tore it up searching for Barron and when he couldn’t find them he shot my dog and kissed my husband. My husband left me for Mike Pence. This app ruined my life.","title":"My dog died????","isEdited":false,"userName":"___munch___"}},{"id":"6175637549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:00:10Z","review":"I downloaded this app and realized I’ve never been more disappointed or disrespected in my entire life. I opened it and it took 3 full minutes to load, which meant I had 3 minutes to take a number 1 and a number 2 and that was insanely hard. Second of all this app is just plain fake news and lies, make America great again or is it make America made of slaves again? Uh uh that’s not okay with me. Third of all the layout is terrible it’s so white I think I went blind. Overall do not get this app it’s not good for your health or your soul.","title":"Ruined My Day","isEdited":false,"userName":"GOOD JOB IN UR LIFE"}},{"id":"6175615047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:51:56Z","review":"I wanted to get the app because I felt SUPER bad about Trump’s Tulsa rally that was totally, absolutely and most definitely not intended to be racist!! Unfortunately though, it took a whole hour to download and when I opened the app it kept glitching. Then while I was using this horribly organized app I got a warning that my phone was getting a virus. I’m so angry!!! I can’t believe our totally non racist, homophobic, white supremacist, etc. president could make an app that gives the users a virus. I’m sorry bunker boy I just can’t keep supporting you after this.","title":"This App Gave me a Virus!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Stacy Smith ;)"}},{"id":"6175601513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:47:01Z","review":"This app is so annoying and stupid when I first tried to download it my phone was froze for at least 5 minutes and then when I clicked it to set it up my phone went black, then when I actually got to put my Mobil phone number and it texted me the 7 digit number a whole bunch of numbers started calling me asking me what I’m wearing and where I live like it was about 5 unknown numbers after the next. I don’t find this funny at all that is highly disrespectful and weird for a app to do this 🤬🤬🤬🤬.","title":"Why is this app even legal","isEdited":false,"userName":"noah bden"}},{"id":"6175594203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:44:22Z","review":"if i could give this 0 stars i would in a second. this app RUINED my LIFE. it also put my mental and physical health in CRITICAL condition. plus the fact the icon of it is a orange? how unoriginal . . . wanna be talking orange so bad and don’t get me wrong orange is a cute color and all ;) but it just look icky there . . . overload on the spray tan. not to mention it’s highly suspicious asking for your phone number right on the spot? i would never recommend using this app as it is a waste of storage and waste of ur time to download and use. right when i opened this app i almost went blind, i felt the need to claw out my eyes to the front page. to give you a example of what i saw let me draw it for you.\n\n    🌽 \n     🍊 \n⬛️🟥⬛️\n⬛️🟥⬛️\n⬛️🍤⬛️\n⬛️     ⬛️\n\nas you can imagine i was HORRIFED. in tears almost. i will not stand for this at all. \n#savebarron2020\n#savetiktok2020\n#hatethisapp\n#0stars\n#dontrecommend\n❤️😼","title":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🌈🌸","isEdited":false,"userName":"🍊🍤🤬🤬❌❌"}}]}
