I was excited to learn more about his great policies through his app. However, i’ve found myself HOMELESS because of this app! After taking 9 days, the blood of a reptile, and the soul of my first born to even finish downloading, i still opened this app hopeful to find useful information provided by our bold leader. Upon opening the app i was met with 27 pop up adds and a virus that makes my phone shut down every 13 minutes! After closing the pop up adds i finally was able to navigate to the homepage of the app only to find misogynistic comments from our president himself. I decided to move past this and continue on to look at some of his merchandise, i found awfully designed t-shirts that look like they paid a squirrel to design. However, i finally found a nice looking shirt that i decided to purchase to display my support. I waited 3 months for the shirt to arrive DESPITE having to pay $30 for the shirt and an extra $340 FOR SHIPPING! After the shirt finally arrived i pulled the package inside, still excited to show off my new merchandise. I opened the package only to be met with THOUSANDS of squirrels POURING out of the box. Within minutes, my whole home was absolutely FLOODED with rabid squirrels, who gave my dogs, Lucky and Luna, rabies, they DIED because of this and shortly after these squirrels ravaged their bodies leaving nothing behind but some bones and their collars!! Not to mention, THERE WAS NO SHIRT IN THE BOX, JUST SQUIRRELS! My house has now been stolen from me by the squirrels. So, I called the Trump administration in hopes they could help me remedy the situation and they agreed to send over a representative to take a look. BUT INSTEAD, 13 genetically engineered squirrel-human hybrids showed up at my home in a limousine and beat up my husband and 9 year old son!! My family is now homeless, living with my sister in minnesota and we cannot afford a home or hospital bills! I will never again use this app after this horrible experience!! 😔😔🐿","title":"This app left me homeless! 🐿","isEdited":false,"userName":"Candy cane 132"}},{"id":"6175604880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:48:15Z","review":"Just what a terrible app","title":"Do not download","isEdited":false,"userName":"austinmarker33"}},{"id":"6175601473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:47:00Z","review":"This app took forever to woke also i hated it","title":"Hate this app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Becca11👑"}},{"id":"6175592122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:43:39Z","review":"Worst app ever I do not recommend","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"natmay🤍"}},{"id":"6175579038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:38:42Z","review":"This app is a form of government spyware!
