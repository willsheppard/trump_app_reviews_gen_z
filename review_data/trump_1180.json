However once I tried to enter the app I repeatedly got several spam messages on my phone, gmail, Apple email, and Twitter/Instagram DM’s. They all said “VOTE FOR ME OR ELSE IM DOUBLING YOUR TAXES AND MURDERING YOUR FAMILY” all from a user named “trump 2020”. Obviously trump is out to get me even in my one attempt to somewhat support him. This proves that he is mentally impaired and unfit for just about anything. I immediately deleted the app and I thought overall that everything had settled. That is until all of my apps turned into the trump app! I brought my phone to the Apple store and thankfully they fixed it. But overall, I hated this app and it should be taken down from the AppStore as soon as possible for the safety of Americans everywhere! So I would not recommend this app."}},{"id":"6177534090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trump2020on a gravestone","date":"2020-07-09T17:17:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"you tried it✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️now don’t ever do it again✨🤪🧚🏻\u200D♀️","review":"Um right off the bat the app was very glitchy. it started giving me problems from the start. also took up way to my storage on my phone and i need the storage for more important and useful stuff worth my time. i believe that if you can’t even correctly run an app then you shouldn’t run a country. this app is giving me very slow “ive got dementia like donald trump “ vibes and i honestly just cannot stand for it. i will not allow an awful app like this to be on the appstore. Even the thought of having a app as horrible as this one exist just makes me want to vote for a turtle as our president and run off to iceland and never come back. this app has honestly caused most of my suicidal tendencies. this only increases my anxiety and threatens my mental health like seriously. DO NOT get this horrible, disgusting, disgrace of an app unless you want a reason to be upset."}},{"id":"6177443295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cöke addîct","date":"2020-07-09T16:50:16Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"SAVE YOUR LIFE DONT DOWNLOAD","review":"It took a week to download, then once it did I went on twitter and all I saw was trump’s nudes on my feed, it was traumatizing. I then went to Walmart so i could get some chips, and when I returned home, my parents and siblings were nowhere to be found. I then had to go through a scavenger hunt to find nothing but their lookalike dolls, and a note saying, “your turn :)” I ran and ran away from men wielding axes and knifes, attempting to stab at my head. I went to my friend’s house and I found her and her family all dead, and I heard a weird noise from the upstairs bathroom. When I checked it out, trump was eating her father’s brains, WITH NO SEASONING. My phone then repeatedly called me racial slurs and asked if I was female, claiming to grab me by somewhere I am unable to discuss. Now I am trapped in my own phone because I stood up to it once, the app harasses me and slaps my face at least once a day. Please release me from my electronic prison."}},{"id":"6176885051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kaitlyn🤡","date":"2020-07-09T14:14:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Bunker boy can stay mad💅💕😘✨🌸🌊","review":"This Cheeto has the audacity to think that he can ban tiktok without a fight. If it gets banned we need to do whatever it takes no matter what for him to get it back. It’s obviously bc he’s throwing a tantrum in the bunker for messing his rally bc ~China~ has been taking data since musically since he’s been president so if it was to do with it we wouldn’t have had tiktok. If tiktok bans, it has been a wonderful time and we were the strongest family there was and now almost every teen is going back to depression but when trumpie the clown sees a rise in therapists and can’t fund that anymore he will have no choice. If we troll his twitter all together replying to tweets and anything he will get mad and if we don’t stop until he gets it back or keeps it. I hope someone reads this and laughs bc I love reading funny ones bc they make my day better, but I hope the Cheeto doesn’t ban the app bc he’s petty😢💕💅🌸✨🌊😭😘"}},{"id":"6175888810","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vreenuh","date":"2020-07-09T09:25:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"⚠️DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! TERRIBLE APP‼️","review":"it took me so long to download this app. HOURS... it took HOURS. and after downloading i noticed it used up all of my icloud and iphone storage space. i couldnt do anything with my phone anymore it wasn't even possible to clear up space. every time i tried opening the app it just crashed. it crashed so much to the point it put my phone onto factory reset. it was even stuck on the apple logo for a couple of hours. it would say i got viruses on my phone when i tried closing the app. it is terrible and i recommend not downloading it. it will plainly just ruin your phone. i have the newest version phone in good shape but this application has ruined everything. my phone isnt as fast anymore and doesnt run as well as it used to. i am upset about this. i suggest to take my review into thought when downloading this app. this was a waste of my time and money. it's horrible i say, H O R R I B L E."}},{"id":"6175876964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Imsofancy85","date":"2020-07-09T09:21:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":".","review":"this app is absolutely horrible, i tried downloading it and it took so long that i was able to conceive a baby and give birth full term. twice. when i was finally able to open the app, i was horribly disappointed. lol sike if you’re actually serious about downloading this app i have serious concerns regarding your morals and overall mental health. if you’re downloading this app because you actually support our president bruh open your eyes. trump is misogynistic, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, transphobic- why are you supporting him? all of the prejudice that people face because of their skin color, race, religion, sexuality, if you’re voting for trump you’re saying that you are for this. you are saying that you are for people facing discrimination because of something they CANT control. what’s wrong with you? we are all human, we all bleed the same blood, a vote for trump is a vote for another four years of hell in our country."}},{"id":"6175543774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"XxtombradyXx","date":"2020-07-09T07:25:43Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","review":"took 47 weeks to just download this app! absolutely ridiculous! and once i opened this app, it didn’t even show the news, but instead freshly baked brownies. i wasn’t mad the slightest bit, until i kept scrolling and I saw my pet parakeet! i looked to see if he was in his cage and then saw that HE WAS GONE! the Oompa Loompa stole my parakeet! I ran out of my house and went looking for my parakeet and i came across a very sketchy playground. i took a closer look and was traumatized! there the Oompa Loompa was shoving my parakeet’s face in the wood chips! in that moment i didn’t know what to do. but then i whacked the Oompa Loompa’s hand and once he let go of my parakeet, my parakeet flew away in fear:( i headed home after that. i was so sad. so if you were planning on getting this app, i beg of you to not get it! unless you want a traumatizing event in your life. this app is literally so bad i would have given this app a zero star rating.

Then, it eventually caused my phone to crash, and it was a pain to get my phone running again. That’s when things started getting weird. I started seeing orange flashes out of the corner of my eye. Every time I turned to see what it was, I saw no one. However, I have been finding strands of orange hair and smudges of cheap self tanner on all of my things. I’m not quite sure what this means, but I’m very concerned. None of this was happening until after I downloaded the app. I’ve since deleted it, but I’m still having the same issue. My dog is going to be sleeping with me tonight. She loves to eat Cheetos, so I know I’ll be safe with her."}},{"id":"6175127169","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bsishdnejfs","date":"2020-07-09T04:48:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP IS THE WORST!","review":"Literally this app will steal ALL OF YOUR INFORMATION!
