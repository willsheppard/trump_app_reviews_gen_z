Scarred for life!","review":"The app tracked my location and then trump showed up and abducted 👽 me and my family. He forced me to get a spray tan to look just like him—an orange!!!! he then blew up my home and i was homeless. I started to love in a box but then Trump started to kick my box down a hill where i then broke all my limbs!! i couldn’t go to the hospital bc American healthcare is expensive!!! DO NOT RECCOMEND!!! He then chopped off my limbs 🦵🦵 and ate them!! 👁👄👁 Then he rolled me into a trump flag and ate me like a burrito 🌯 !!! He threw me up though because of the fake tan and then stomped on my remains.","date":"2020-07-09T00:06:57Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Érica logue"}},{"id":"6174196866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible 😤","review":"This app is so horrifying. The moment I opened the app I was greeted with racial slurs and derogatory terms! How could anyone allow this? I have no idea why it was allowed onto the App Store when it’s refers to false statements such as “make America great again.” There is no way this Oompa Loompa could “make” or even take part in “making” America great again. America wasn’t great to begin with!? The US is built on killing and inslaving Natives. This app is horrible and even sends inappropriate notifications from unknown websites, which is NOT appropriate for an app.","date":"2020-07-09T00:01:00Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"But here's my ideas"}},{"id":"6174143475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gave my 15 DiFfReNt types of STDS 😔🧚✨","review":"It was all good and dandy until I opened 😳🖖🏽 n all of a sudden an over greased jumbo Cheeto puff pooped up 🤓👾 i was like eww 😷💕‼️ but the worst part about it was throwing it back 🤬👀 but when I tell u it stank i mean it 🥴👄 it stank like a taco from taco bell sitting on a counter for exactly 3 months and 73 day 🌝🥶 and after all that you’d think this be over but i started to smell something FiShY 🐠😨 i open my leg and I gagged 🤢💩 that jumbo Cheeto puff gave me 15 different stds 🤒 so in conclusion don’t download this app unless ur trynna be the new lovely peaches 🍑🤩🤪😍🥰🧚\u200D♀️✨","date":"2020-07-08T23:41:28Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"pennywise 🧚🥰🍑💩"}},{"id":"6174118581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no ❤️","review":"i only downloaded this app out of respect because i felt bad about what happened at his tulsa rally and this is by far my the WORST app i ever downloaded. i opened the app to see a picture of an orange orangutan on the screen. i tried signing up and my screen kept glitching and freezing. i then went out of the app to try and fix the issue but it showed a picture and him getting a spray tan completely NAKED. i definitely do not recommend this app to anyone after this incredibly inappropriate experience.","date":"2020-07-08T23:32:10Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Ilovecupcakes🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂"}},{"id":"6174050766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😡","review":"지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n생각만으로 포근해져\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh","date":"2020-07-08T23:07:24Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"stan twice & stream more&more"}},{"id":"6174033717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’ll never be the same","review":"As soon as i downloaded this app, i very excitedly opened it to show any support i could against the haters. I was immediately hit in the face with what seems to be Cheeto dust. My eyes started burning ‘one can only assume it was spicy Cheeto dust’. I did my best to wash my eyes, but the after affects feel like I’m constantly getting stringy hairs from a balding man blown into my eyes. I’m having trouble walking up ramps, holding glasses of water and even worse... I’ve become attracted to my daughter. I would NOT recommend this app!

But then I see a an UGLY CHEETO!!! EWWW. The toxic thing made me barf and I started shrinking! Then I saw this yummy container with shrek on it so I munched on it. Then I became a block of concrete. I looked at my phone only to have the toxic fumes evaporate me. I was just being air so I go in a store to be air there. But I see a pack of Cheetos that had that weird sweaty Cheeto on it!! I was so disgusted and traumatized that I turned into lava and rolled home to smash my phone and I am texting this in a summoning circle to banish the Cheeto into Antarctica.

It was so incredibly disgusting I almost threw up. Oh and bunker baby ran over my pet snail because I didn’t come to his rally, he owes me a new pet snail😡.
