It automatically started glitching when I opened it. It was filled with things that were very offensive to me. This is an app that will help no one and is harmful to not only my brain but to the phone itself and the people around me. When I had this app open and put my phone on silent. It started making loud pinging noises while I was at a funeral and it was very inappropriate!! I am very upset by the trauma this app has caused me and others. It needs to be deleted from the store IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT download this app!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"THE MOST HEINOUS APP IN THIS STORE","date":"2020-07-09T03:48:59Z","userName":"Angrygirl0123"}},{"id":"6174881907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I originally got this to show my unending support to my Cheeto dipped god but unfortunately it’s just a horrible app!! It constantly crashes and sent me hundreds of notifications a day. Additionally, my phone battery would drain 10x quicker than before I downloaded it. I blindly trust everything I am told, however I even found some mistakes in the news and information. Good patriots should not have to suffer through this terrible app to support the Cheeto god. Do better dump administration!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Just a little too racist for my liking","date":"2020-07-09T03:31:21Z","userName":"uiuggdc"}},{"id":"6174779386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"One of the things you Have to fill out is a picture of your passport so they can steal your info and in the user guidelines it says that it steals data from your location and if you try and delete the app you will get a notification that your phone is being hacked and all your information is stolen. If you want  to risk your personal information getting leaked to hackers so they can come to your house while your sleeping this is the perfect app for you.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I was hacked because I downloaded this app","date":"2020-07-09T03:01:04Z","userName":"Jazmin lynn"}},{"id":"6174777791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app expecting I would become the president but it lied! It lied to me. I tried making my pet bird the president too but that didn’t work either. My microwave and oven do not condone this type of behavior. I would like to speak to the president directly about this Faldo advertising app. It’s not fair, like, and orange gets to be president but my anime ghost can’t? What is this foul app, it is meant for mean dinosaurs and bad microwaves. Do not download this app if you’re expecting something better than a waste of space on your phone. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!😼✌🏼","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"✨perfect✨","date":"2020-07-09T03:00:34Z","userName":"trump2020✨❤️in coffin😘😻"}},{"id":"6174769755","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

Whenever I look at, interact with or open this app, my eyes begin to burn. I have no diagnosed eye issues, but EXCLUSIVELY when I see this app my eyes begin to water. My forehead throbs. I feel a migraine coming on. I’d try putting on sunglasses, but the sheer...how do I say this...WHITENESS of the app has caused me temporary blindness and migraines. I’m sure other frequent users can relate, and unfortunately it seems some have started to prefer their world that way. Not worth the headache for me. Will be deleting soon (and again in November 2020).","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrendous Color Scheme!","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:30Z","userName":"Twi-Fan12"}},{"id":"6174738119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is one of the worst apps in the app store.
