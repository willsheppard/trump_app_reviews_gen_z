Don’t Download","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"nazarooski (pronounce that!)","review":"First things first. The app asked me to give it my finger print. Typically I don’t like to give that kind of privacy to the government unless it is to a trusted white police officer. But I thought, this is my guy, Trump, the richest man in the whole world behind Jeff Bezos (that huffpuff washington post MFer), when has he ever steered me or this country wrong?!? So I trusted him and pressed my thumb down on the app. \n\nI was then asked for my phone number. I figure I give that up enough to get three spam calls a day from CHIna, so no big deal. But before I could finish my account, I got three phone calls, one was from Donald himself! At least I thought it was him at first. But it was just a robo call asking for a donation and slamming that old slow joe Biden into the dirt. I gave them my credit card number and $50 just for how good the robo call was. But then I got calls from Mitch McConnell’s and Lindsey Graham’s campaigns asking for money too! They sounded desperate... I did not give them money as I already spent my monthly allotment on Big D and fishin equipment for the summer (they say it’s a good Covid19 activity). \n\nFinally, I finish my account and they ask for my SSN and want to know if I own any guns! This I cannot abide. My 2nd AMMENDMENT RIGHTS tell me I can have as many guns as I like and I don’t have to tell the government. \n\nI AM SO DISAPPOINTED THAT TRUMP WANTS TO TAKE OUR GUNS AWAY! First he sends in the military to the cities. I get it. Uppity liberals makin all kinds of trouble. But then he wants to make a police state around the country and know where all the guns are so he can target his forces?!? Nope! Won’t do it.\n\nI immediate turned off my location services, deleted the app and called back the Trump robo number and demanded a refund of my $50 donation and $1 tip. \n\nI took it a step further and deregistered to vote. I want no part of this government going forward. DONT DOWNLOAD, DONT VOTE!"}},{"id":"6068032300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-12T19:46:09Z","title":"Papa","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"witchofthebayou","review":"This app killed my father"}},{"id":"6065957911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-12T07:54:04Z","title":"-10/10","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"superhannahish","review":"Bad cheeto"}},{"id":"6055896582","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-09T18:58:34Z","title":"Just awful","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"clamencek","review":"Evegegevet whg"}}]}
