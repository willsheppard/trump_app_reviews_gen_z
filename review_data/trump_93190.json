All in life was swell, dandy even, until the incident. On the horrible disastrous day of June 19th I, a simpleton minding her own business, received a crude message. The notification said, “I’ve never seen a skinny person drink a Diet Coke”. Now normally, such words would not bother a strong woman like me, but in that moment, I, Miss Angelina Melanin Johnson III, was drinking none other than a Diet Coke. I was shocked and abhorred that I would receive such a message. Then I came to a world shattering realization: how could he have known I was drinking a Diet Coke? The only possible explanation was that he, my savior, was.... watching me. I shook and trembled in fear wrapped in my shawl. I cautiously tiptoed to my window, fearing the worst. As I slowly turned open the blinds, I saw him. That horrible, despicable, beast of a man. That creature had beady little eyes that shook me to my core. From that window  I saw my “esteemed” Donny. I knew that I had to do something to rid me of that nightmare. I gathered my salt and sage chanting to the spirits to help me remove the evil. He started to break in. He screamed words that would burn into my soul: “HERE’S DONNY”. He came closer and I tried even harder to banish him. He stood over me with a bible in his right hand and a gun in the other. I shouted out every curse I knew. After one last chant I collapsed. And from the corner of my eye I saw that creature wither away into a pile of ashes. And in that moment I knew, I would never trust a man again.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177970868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP MADE ME CRI","date":"2020-07-09T19:34:29Z","userName":"Orange cheeto stAn","review":"I was looking through the App Store one day, and was delighted to find out the big orange ✨Cheeto✨ (Or dorito- Idk I get mixed up sometimes) had an app. I downloaded it excited to find other ✨👏💅🏻Cheeto-Dorito✨👏💅🏻stans, but the app took around a week to update. In the MEANTIME I made some fan art bc they OBVIOUSLY they had a page for it. I got the orange for his skin but STILL can’t find the right amount of white supremacy to mix in 😔 The app had FINALLY downloaded- But I still had time to ride Pete the dragon to the donut shop. This app made me lag and the ADMIN of the server told me to stop complaining and gave me some SOGGY donuts💅🏻✨🧚. I got mad and told him they were soggy, but he told me to stop trolling and grow antlers sometime. Unfortunately, when I was finally able to open the app I found that all my hair had MYSTERIOUSLY fallen off! I am now forced to wear a wig that looks like a pellet of owl barf for the next 89 years. Wait- Now I have the urge to get a bright orange spray tan. Maybe the standing like a penguin pack is available? Anyways, I opened the app and was SHOCKED to find the result of a OOMPA-LOOMPA and a disfigured PENGUIN dipped in orange juice. I threw my phone out the window in ✨Shock✨ only to find that a creepy Russian dude was flipping through it for my info. In my panic I assumed this was that guy from stranger things S3 that MURDERED cherry slushy king. I was quick to hit him over the head with the chair that chased the kids in my basement out when he EXPLOITED and DELETED my head mesh. I guess this is a weird bug. Anyways, that was my review 💅🏻✨. I think imma worship a Pringle next time 😌✌️.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177960421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"You can’t stop us","date":"2020-07-09T19:31:08Z","userName":"@gilinskychild","review":"This app SUCKED and so does Trump!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177956376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hi","date":"2020-07-09T19:29:52Z","userName":"Koolerkidthanyou","review":"Tiktok is amazing I worked to hard to just get banned so yeah love you Trump 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡👁👅👁","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177952572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is doo doo","date":"2020-07-09T19:28:37Z","userName":"sophiaamill28","review":"If i were to make a doo doo app it would be this one","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
