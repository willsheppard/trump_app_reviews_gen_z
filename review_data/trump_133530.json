Once I got into this app is glitched and showed this weird orange Cheeto thing on my screen. Oh wait it was you! 💅🏽💅🏽 I just wanted to support my president that mad America worse by getting this app. I support him so much that I decided to buy some tickets, but my talking lizard reminded be that it wants to go to Disney World today. We couldn’t because we had a lousy president that doesn’t know how to take care of this country properly and now so many people are dying because “If you don’t test for Covid, there won’t be any cases.” Anyways I just want to say, and Gen-Z with take over.
