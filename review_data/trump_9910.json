They were mainly inappropriate notifications and I was getting fed up from always clicking the exit button from these disturbing notifications. And due to this, I’ve been getting more scam likely phone calls. This is one of the worst apps I’ve ever downloaded!!"}},{"id":"6174856410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"NOT WORTH It","date":"2020-07-09T03:23:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"stephanie 😼","review":"This app messed up my phone ,my phone started glitching and saying trump 2020 all over it ,I had to restart it ,it’s a waste of space ✨, as soon as I got it ,it started glitching and kept crashing would not recommend.

I will never get the 30 seconds I spent on this app back. It’s going to haunt me for the rest of my life.. what I could’ve done with that time. I am urging anyone that is thinking about this app to reconsider for the sake of your family, mental, and emotional state. I also want to urge the app store to take down this app to prevent others from the horrible fate that I was subjected to."}},{"id":"6174765702","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Pretty sure this app stole my info","date":"2020-07-09T02:56:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"s_nyc","review":"I got like a million notifications in the first day, even though I had notifications turned off. My phone kept crashing and coincidence or not, a few days after downloading my credit score dropped 100 points and someone used my social security number to open 5 credit cards.

I soon came to find out that this “annoying orange” is much more annoying the the lovable orange from tv. I soon then deleted the app and cleanse my eyes and soul from what I had whiteness by drinking bleach and pouring it down my face into my eyes. It did not help. My soul was not yet cleansed and I don’t think it ever will be again."}},{"id":"6174729573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T02:45:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Liza Jane iPhone","review":"I thought that downloading this app would be an incredible experience as it would allow me to support our lord and savior mr president as he works to get re-elected again this November. As it turns out downloading this app was a HUGE mistake, constant notifications, glitches, and app crashes have made it IMPOSSIBLE to use this app. What’s worse, as soon as the app was installed my phone crashed and took an HOUR to reboot. I was expecting a MUCH higher quality app mr president."}}]}
