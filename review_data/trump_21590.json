I don’t know what it is, but as soon as I started using this app my brain seemed foggy and I felt overcome with hatred and bigotry. I immediately ran outside and screamed racial slurs at my black neighbor. We have been friends for 25 years. When did I become a racist?? I immediately deleted the app. And now I feel fine :)","title":"Zero stars","date":"2020-07-09T13:36:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"1L law student","rating":1}},{"id":"6176739864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not only did this app take forever to download but after i finally got it downloaded it corrupted my phone.

When it did finish downloading, it kept crashing and lagging so I figured I would delete it and then download it again, but to no avail. It still would not work.
