I am voting for Biden in November because he is committed to providing access to affordable healthcare for all, securing the border while facilitating the processes for legal immigration and asylum, and empowering the working class.  He will also spread the true and current facts of COVID-19 instead of lying to protect his image, unlike our current president who's irresponsibility has put millions of lives at risk.

It took 3 months for this app to download even though I’ve been connected to WiFi 😩. Once I got in the app the home screen had a terrible picture on it, some orange wrinkly popped balloon of a man. I am having trouble sleeping even thinking about that image. This is currently night 7 of no sleep because they decided to use a picture of Trump for the home screen. 😔 Another complaint I have is that whenever I open the app my phone sets of FIRE. In my humble opinion that’s not very swag of Mr.Donald Trump to do 🍊. As I write this review I am having to pay for therapy for my phone. My phone is currently going through physical therapy because of the burns, and mental therapy because this app has left a deep scar in my phone. Please rate this app 1 star. For I have been through a lot trying to help my phone with all of its troubles because of this app. I wish my life could return to normal, but sadly every time I close my eyes (even to blink) I have to see the horrific image of that wrinkly old dried out ompaloopa seared in my memory FOREVER. Words can never truly express my pain. 😔😿","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:30:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"😔 WORST APP EVER 😩"}},{"id":"6173792156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MatiwithaT","review":"This app made my phone glitch and gave it a virus!!

I think this app gave my phone a virus because I had to get a new phone.  I continued to get ads on my phone for trump hotels and rally’s.  I do not support president trump, this app was only for educational purposes.  If you are thinking of getting this app, DO NOT.  I am outraged because this was a brand new phone and this app gave it a virus.  Also photos from my camera roll that I had no intention of deleting were gone and I would open my phone and apps would be gone (tik tok, Twitter, YouTube etc.)  I will NEVER be downloading this app again and I suggest you do not either.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:30:03Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE"}},{"id":"6173791969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👹😍👹","review":"OKAY OKAY SO HA YEAH IM A COMEDIAN YOU LISTEN TO ME K?
