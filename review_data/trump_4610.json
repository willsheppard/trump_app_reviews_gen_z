But that’s not the craziest I was just sleeping in my old man bed when I started hearing “sacrifice sacrifice” from my pantry I was horrified to find out it was my potatoes trying to scarfice me so as horrified as I was they started saying “big Cheeto man will now take you” I was so horrified that I started running when they attacked. Then I remember it was this app ever since I downloaded it weird things where happening","userName":"shloom noom","date":"2020-07-09T01:18:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Attacking potatoes","rating":1}},{"id":"6174415162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"To start, this app killed my grandma and dog on the same day. Plus, it called me a thug and started yelling at me. I passed out when the T started spinning because I have epilepsy and had to go to the ER, there should be a warning for that. Than I threw up when I woke up at the hospital because when I opened my phone this picture of a disgusting orange rotten cheeto was on my phone and they ran tests on me and found out that I have a severe reaction to the color orange that started around 4 years ago. I would not recommend this app to anyone, I am still recovering from the trauma and hope to eat oranges and any other orange this in Novemeber.","userName":"alyssaheusted","date":"2020-07-09T01:14:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I’m speechless","rating":1}},{"id":"6174392391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can’t understand why anyone would keep this app after downloading it. The app format: horrible. The content of the app: horrible. This app is extremely unprofessional. I didn’t know they made apps for rapists to run for president 🤮 and it didn’t even tell me that on the app before downloading. Turns out, the same guy accused of sexual assault is also extremely racist, homophobic and xenophobic. AND THEY MADE AN APP FOR HIM?!! I’m not any of those things and I don’t have an app for me and I’m not running for president. From downloading this app I can see the person this app is all about generally just hates people. 0/5 stars","userName":"krodhwofkapdjwkd","date":"2020-07-09T01:07:53Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app, awful content","rating":1}},{"id":"6174349232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First, was that really that best model you could find? The one dressed in a suit and red tie, yeah, it looks like an angry man-baby-pig who’s trying to hold in explosive diarrhea. God forbid I see that creature again, my eye doctor told me to stay as far away as possible from it, or I’ll have to have emergency eye removal surgery. \n\n     Second, who actually like trump? What was one GOOD thing he accomplished? Nothing❤️ \n\n     Third, I’m gonna need you to send me a $6,000 check, that featherless vulture already damaged my eyes so bad, they disintegrated, I’m contemplating about suing, but I think that if you get a gentle heads up, you’ll know next time to get a model who doesn’t looks like a oger sweating profusely. \n\n     And if you decide not to send me the check for my medical bill, Pray to god that I don’t hunt you down like the animal you are, and remove your toenails with the aid of a pair of pliers, and feed them to you.❤️\n\n                                                           Sincerely, Disintegrated Eyes","userName":"Sara The Bookworm","date":"2020-07-09T00:54:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Yeah❤️ (no btw)","rating":1}},{"id":"6174322973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to support my favorite color but when i opened the app all of a sudden a shrimp appeared in front of my face. i almost started to cry from the horrifying image that i saw😿🙀 i opened the app in front of my mother and close friend and when my mother saw what i was looking at she disowned me and never looked back. my friend on the other hand cast me out of my own home and now her and my mother live there together without me. this app has caused horrible trauma in my life and given me severe ptsd and i only have one person to blame😡😡it is that horrifying cheeto that showed up on my screen with his horrible shrimp when i first opened the app. not only has this app caused me trauma but it is also filled with lies about the cheeto, who is evil and who has ruined my life 😖😭 as i have explained earlier this app is horrible and i would give it 0 stars if i could😡🤬i have since deleted the app and will never be re-downloading. so yeah❤️","userName":"imscreaming_","date":"2020-07-09T00:45:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"very scary experience 😿","rating":1}},{"id":"6174278961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I am absolutely appalled by the indecently this app provides. I downloaded it to show all my friends and family how beautiful and sexy Mr. Cheeto trump is. As I was showing my mom, Trump reached out of the screen, put her in a chokehold, and said “Jyna” quietly into her ear. This caused my moms ear to cave in on itself and then fall off completely. So I started ruching my mom to the hospital, but silly me!! I forgot to delete this app. The whole way there, trump screamed delusional things such as “my dick is big... ext..) this caused me and my mother to simultaneously go into cardiac arrest and die.  Therefore at this time, I am writing this reancarnated as a dog. (Which is NOT my first choice of reancarnation BTW) anyway, ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","userName":"86642116890043211poop","date":"2020-07-09T00:30:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6174229142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This was by far, the WORST app I have ever used. First off, the president is insanely hideous and as soon as I opened the app I had to see his face. Secondly, Trump is terrible and I hate him (anyone but Cheeto Man 2020). Lastly, I just want to say that he is very ugly and I don't want to have to deal with his face again. God knows how he landed a chick like Melania. The only reason I am leaving a one-star review is, well, it requires me to do so in order to write this, but also because the people who worked on this seemed to have worked hard on this and I feel bad. Basically the only reason I am doing this is because Cheeto Man needs to GO.","userName":"Pancy Parkinson","date":"2020-07-09T00:13:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF OF APP STORE ASAP!!!!","rating":1}}]}
