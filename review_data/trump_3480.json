My phone was stuck on this screen for almost an hour! Once the app finally downloaded, I opened it up and immediately my phone started glitching out. I was so confused. I tried to continue looking through the app and it was like my phone wouldn’t let me. This app is absolutely TERRIBLE. I had to restart my phone and delete the app just to be able to do anything else. Even by just getting to see ace things on this app, I could tell that it is the WORST app ever to exists. Don’t waste your time, it’s only stupidity that comes out of this Cheetos mouth anyways ✨🍊","userName":"Abadaba0201🚀","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:14:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173444241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app i’ve ever downloaded in my entire life.","review":"i really don’t like donald dump but i wanted to see what he offered in his app. let me just say, this app took A WEEK TO DOWNLOAD. once downloaded, i couldn’t even open it because it kept crashing. i let it sit for a day but then the app caused my phone to glitch so bad. i deleted the app. a few days later, i’m looking through my camera roll and somehow the app placed tons of photos of donald dump IN MY CAMERA ROLL. I didn’t give the app permission to do this. i was furious. then in the middle of the night, my phone started chanting TRUMP 2020. i was horrified. i cant believe the president of the united states has such a terrible app and he has the audacity to ban tik tok?

How sad that a president makes a non working app to use for his people! I saw a orange clown in the app when i first opened it and the orange clown looked like some roach. The app makes you have a virus on your phone and tracks down your location and stalks your search history. I opened the app and it said “would you like turn on your location” Why would i need my location for a trump app? I got at least 20 viruses on my phone bc of this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD remember its slow, has a ugly clown, gives your viruses, and tracks down your location and history! \n\n✨🏳️\u200D🌈Anyways bring back tiktok, your app is worse then tiktok 🏳️\u200D🌈✨","userName":"✨🏳️\u200D🌈Bernie Sanders 🏳️\u200D🌈✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:09:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173372813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE 😫😫😫😫","review":"It took 2 months to download and during that time, my phone could only play Despacito!!🤮 Then when it did download, my phone screen got an orange tint 🍊 and it was BLINDING. So I was havin a sick convo with some dude on here, but then... I can’t erase the memory of an orange face popping up on my screen! I’m a huge fan of horror and enjoy jumpscares but this was TOO MUCH. It was so horrible that my cat grabbed my phone and tried to perform an exorcism but NOTHING CHANGED!!! Until we chanted “be gone thOt” three times, and my phone was cured! But... the next day... MY CAT TURNED ORANGE. My cat is orange and IDK WHAT TO DO 😩!!! I thank her everyday for the sacrifice she has made to rid my phone of the face. How did the annoying orange become our president???!?!?! 😫😫😫😩😩","userName":"LizChisaki","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:02:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173258192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gross","review":"This app is spreading false information and i can’t get anywhere in the app without being bombarded by a fat orange creature. It’s like he’s watching me every time i see his beady little eyes. I downloaded this app to be more aware of trumps campaign and it did the exact opposite this app is basically just like the Jeremy Renner app. This man is obsessed with himself and it is really showing through this app. At least it’s good to know we have a narcissistic, racist, rapist, homophobic, sexist, xenophobic, islamiphobic, orange, lying cheeto puff of a man as our president. 👍👍 but Trump 2020 🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷 am i right ? It also took a whole day to download but i’m on Wifi and have enough storage. I voted for Trump last year but i won’t be voting for him again.","userName":"period.danielle.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:23:55Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173240891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"yes teens are reviewing","review":"to the people saying we should have to be old enough to vote to use this app and write a review. okay boomer. maybe you should have to have morals and values to be able to vote, or actually respect other people’s existence and not call liberals “libtards”, just because you’re an insecure little conservative boomer doesn’t mean you get to tell teens who are fully educated on the subject to not leave a review. i am fully educated and by the way you guys are talking it doesn’t really seem like YOU are educated. how does it feel to have teenagers know more about politics than you do? not good? i didn’t think so. next time, put your privilege where your mouth is :) same goes to the president:)))))))","userName":"rip jessie:(","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:18:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172978514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣","review":"This is the worst app ever.

Then the mice in my room came to see what happened. The mice saw the  the phone and died after seeing the app open in the phone. I wasn’t sure what to do. Do I call the ambulance or do I let it just die. Then the dead mice’s friend also came out and started crying after seeing its friend dead on the floor. Then the mice 🐁 couldn’t live with out his friend and commuted sucide at the scene. So this is the worst app ever. It caused 2 poor mice to die. 😣 Rip mice 🐁","userName":"skinny✨✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:54:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172841687","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Fake news","review":"The things on this app are just terrible. There isn’t much real information that sways me to vote for him. The app is focused only on his supporters he doesn’t want to capture more. He wants statistic he can use and he wants to hypnotize his voters more than he already has. The app is based to set up fake statistics for his campaign. Technically they aren’t fake but if he puts a poll on an app full of his supporters he isn’t addressing the other side which makes them fake or at least unusable. Everything is focusing on why he’s great he isn’t showing people his wrongs and trying to right them. He’s ignoring them all together to get votes which is disgusting. The app is terrible and I will not be voting for trump!","userName":"Dom and Jenna","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:12:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172752214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I will need years of therapy because of this app","review":"First of all the app took a week to download and as soon as I opened it there was a loud screeching in my ears that caused me to puke my brains out. It was so disgusting that the only way I could get it out of my mind was to pour bleach in my eyes. Ive been having night terrors every night since I first opened the app. Not to mention the app smelled terrible it smelled as if someone had put a toupee on a rotting Chito ❤️💋🧚\u200D♀️🦋.i’ve also seen some apparitions in my house of what looks like Donald himself and I’m still not able to even go near my phone because of what happened... anyway this all happened because I downloaded the Trump app so don’t do it for your own safety. 😣","userName":"Justin Bieber himself","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:46:55Z","isEdited":false}}]}
