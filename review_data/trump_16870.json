But I was SHOCKED to see that it brought demons and evil spirits into my household👹😈. As soon as I tapped onto it, my house 🏡 shook and the lights 💡 went out. An ominous voice boomed 💣throughout the halls. I’m scared😵 for my life now. I’m here hiding in my room. Sooooo.... thanks a lot. This might be my end.","userName":"Gabbie Hannah Girl","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173805013","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:35:00Z","rating":1,"title":"I’m DISGUSTED","review":"This app is the worst thing I’ve ever downloaded! It brought in much bad luck! While I was on the app it hacked and tracked all of my activity AND it made me break my arm! Much bad. Me hate. I can’t believe it’s still in the App Store. It will ruin people’s privacy and it will BRAINWASH the people who use it to think it’s okay to give all your information up. If there was a 0 star rating I would give it that!","userName":"gen-z refuses to go down","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173798454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:32:28Z","rating":1,"title":"This App is Worth Less than 1 Star","review":"This app caused my phone to go into a default. It became crashing and wouldn’t stop giving me notifications once I got it up again. I took it to my phone distributor and they said that my phone needed to be wiped completely. So now I have a cleaned phone with nothing on it but what it looks like your first time getting a phone. DO NOT GET THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR WHOLE PHONE TRASHED!","userName":"::m::o::r::g::a::n::","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173785965","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:27:48Z","rating":1,"title":"Disgustang","review":"This app is absolutely horrible. It took 69 days to download and then even after it downloaded, I had to try opening the app 420 times before it actually worked. Even after I got it to work, it was still super glitchy. All it shows is a picture of a Cheeto in a suit?? Bizarre if you ask me, this app could use some serious work 🤢","userName":"fcktrump :)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173785867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:27:46Z","rating":1,"title":"The worst app I’ve ever downloaded","review":"This app is so terrible in like every way, it bugs out and glitches every time I open it. And whenever I close out the app I look down and there is Cheeto dust on my fingers....I don’t even eat Cheetos. Since I’ve gotten it I’ve also started to notice that my hair is turning like a gross white blonde. I’m really unsettled and just wish this app could cease to exist.","userName":"Buttknuckle184737382848","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173774946","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:23:41Z","rating":1,"title":"Trump App","review":"Cannot actually believe this is an app. If i were to ever to actually try and respect any work done by the president this would be the final straw that sends me over the edge. This app should not be on the store its buggy, simple, misinformed and I hope no kids can ever see this embarrassment of what this president calls an app. Download something else this is not worth your energy or time.👎🏾","userName":"QRH8","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173772906","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:22:57Z","rating":1,"title":"Do not recommend 😌","review":"I wanted to see what all the hype was about🌚 and the app took 3 hours to load and after loading preceding to open all my apps and go through my information 😳👺 i finally open the app and see a picture of our great pumpkin being spray tanned while naked🤢🤮 I am disgusted by the little baby carrot I had to see 100% do not recommend this app","userName":"yary08","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173763421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:19:28Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"This app wouldn’t stop glitching my phone and turning it off I had to turn my phone off five times a day just to have it work because of this app it was the worst thing I’ve ever had on my phone it just showed me ads and it wouldn’t stop my phone calls out and stopping my music and just basically ruining everything on my phone","userName":"le200000001","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173717456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:02:34Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible i had to get checked for lice.","review":"I downloaded the trump app for reassurance, to see if my president was doing any good. But as soon as it downloaded it made a piercing sound, which resulted into me scratching my head. Uncontrollable. Bugs are in my hair now. I had to go to my local walgreens and get a lice treatment. The lady at the register gave me a dirty look. I’m so ashamed.
