Then once it downloaded I thought I would have gotten to see all the updates on my non-racist, non-homophobic, cis-gendered, orange, all American president. This was definitely a disappointment when I got the app only to see that it had take the photos of my siblings and DONALD J. TRUMP himself messaged me on my phone number and called them, “hideous, and disgusting Jewish, children,” and that they should, “jump of the nearest cliff.” I am completely DISGUSTED.","date":"2020-07-09T09:08:24Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6175812954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Melania👁👄👁","review":"This app gave out unreliable and untrue news worse than CNN! At first I believed that this app had the potential to make the app store great again, however I quickly realized that this app was a hoax. This app is absolutely corrupted; It seemed to build an understandable yet completely unnecessary firewall. In which, the firewall was unsuccessful and very determined and hardworking ads/viruses seemed to multiple as a result. I would NOT recommend this app to ANYONE!","date":"2020-07-09T09:00:28Z","title":"Disappointed but not shocked"}},{"id":"6175710923","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"eddyennyaubs","review":"it took 10 years for the app to download. 10 years. it’s just absurd. When it finally loaded onto my phone, it hacked every single one of my files. It eventually crashed so badly that my phone melted right before my eyes.  As it melted away, Trump’s voice played from my speaker saying “ha I destroyed your phone. I’m rich I can afford a new one you can’t”. It’s ironic that Cheetoman’s rude, ungodly, unholy actions quite literally formed a huge hole in the center of my phone.","date":"2020-07-09T08:25:31Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!"}},{"id":"6175587382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Juliar1028","review":"This is one of the worst apps I’ve ever used. Not only does it constantly crush the dreams of equality in America, but it has major bugs that aggressively advocate the continuation of systematic racism, and the oppression of women and the lgbtq+ community. However, this app has no qualifications or intelligence so it is simple to use. This does make it utterly useless, though, and destructive to those looking to be informed on basic human rights. Hope this can all be fixed this November !! 🧚\u200D♂️🧚🏿✨✨💗💗💗","date":"2020-07-09T07:41:52Z","title":"TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6175584820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"sarahhsss","review":"I downloaded this app and immediately noticed something was off with my phone after it asked for my phone number. I looked in my settings and realized that I’d contracted some sort of virus and my data was being used. I then found Trump’s leaked pictures in my camera roll, which I was appalled by and wanted to throw up. I’m sorry, but I have no choice but to give a one star rating, and I would give 0 if I could 😿","date":"2020-07-09T07:40:53Z","title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6175521169","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"lovelya518","review":"Not cool. 10/10 wouldn’t recommend this app.  \nI got this app to keep up with MY BELOVED president. Once downloaded I began getting a bunch of glitches and my phone literally grew legs and tried to take over my family, it’s been a few weeks now but the phone robot has us all locked in a bathroom and only feeds us once a day. It keeps saying things to itself but I can’t really hear from in here, I don’t know I’m going to go investiga..","date":"2020-07-09T07:17:16Z","title":"Dissapointed."}},{"id":"6175488766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Egrah 🤩","review":"as a white man in america, i’m all for trump 2020 🇱🇷. so when i heard about this app i was excited to see what daddy trump had in plan 😋🤪. i was so disappointed in how slow and terrible this app is, it took days to download and they found my AP address and told me that if i didn’t buy trumps merch they’ll break into my house and shoot me !!😡 not a way to treat a white man in america i’m telling you this is the last you’ll be hearing from me !! biden 2020 🇲🇾","date":"2020-07-09T07:04:24Z","title":"So disappointed 🤦🏼\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6175479595","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Nileta","review":"I had downloaded this app for my dad, and suddenly he turned in this racist, child touching, homophobic predator. Then I read the terms and services, the fine print, and it says that you’ll become just like the president. We checked our bank account and we were bankrupt!! I couldn’t believe it! I immediately deleted the app and then everything went back to normal. Never downloading this app again!!","date":"2020-07-09T07:00:50Z","title":"Absolutely horrible"}},{"id":"6175331220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"joobohobo","review":"This app ironically was very similar to trumps presidency. It didn’t work and actually wouldn’t even download and when I finally got it to download, it didn’t do anything. The app kept crashing and then would just blurt out a bunch of unintelligent nonsense. Then it wouldn’t let me delete the app to the point where I considered burning my phone just so that I would never have to experience it again. Horrible app for a horrible president. Screw Donald Trump.","date":"2020-07-09T06:03:38Z","title":"no"}},{"id":"6175319795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"johnnnnmy","review":"I’m a HUGE “trump supporter” I was very disappointed with this app. First off it was opening other apps. Also it was copying all my contact numbers to the app. It started to scan my photo library and everything I quickly deleted. I suggest to everyone not the get it please if you want to keep your kids safe and out of reach please do so. It is the worst app ever I expected way more from out “best” president🤣\n\nP.S(I’m not no trump supporter🌸🧚🏼🌈✨)","date":"2020-07-09T05:59:05Z","title":"Not worth it stay away"}}]}
