Anyways I went to the ER and they did surgery on me but I was fine I just had a disease called Trump Syndrome, when you feel so disgusted by a certain trumpet that you physically become ill! Then I went home and tried to eat cereal but it came to life and told me it wouldn’t let me eat it unless I was against trump and I was like HONEY WHAT DO YOU THINK so the honey told the cereal to stop being unrealistic and let me get some food I’m ma hungry belly, so I ate the cereal and it tasted good. When I was done, I went to microwave my plate but it completely shattered and engulfed my house in little pieces of glass that just kept spreading and spreading as a weird dark sticky substance, it took over my house then my neighborhood then my state then America, and that was the plague of trump. Then TikTok and Gen Z worked hard and made the plague disappear, then we force fed Trump the sticky black stuff until he was the size of a balloon. Well, a bigger balloon than he already is. Is that an insult to balloons? Idk anyways k BYEEEEE","title":"CHEEZITZ ARE BETTER THAN TRUMP","userName":"Yay and Awww","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:43:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179478003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Oops my finger slipped one day and accidentally downloaded this app!!!
