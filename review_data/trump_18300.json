And also people who are in charge of a cult aka the troompa loompas. And also this app denied my basic rights as a human being and put my friends in a cage. Also this app drowned my fish.

It doesn’t even make sense why this app is allowed on the App Store. I think chewing shards of glass would be a better use of your time. It has also been proven to brainwash. The evidence lies with all the 5 star reviews. Those poor people have been brainwashed and are unaware of their actions. DELETE THIS APP","userName":"genzforpresidenf","title":"SAVE YOURSELF","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:18:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178103794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m sorry if I offend any trump supporters but trumps ideas for our country are worthless and stupid. He has no common sense to run a country. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. And when he’s on social media all he does is make rude comments. He’s a terrible person and I don’t recommend this app to anyone if you don’t support trump. He has no brain.","userName":"ihatelifesm","title":"Nothing new","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:18:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178078631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app just to check up on our most beloved cheeto but to my dismay the app was full of so many ads for hentai?? like I don’t rly mind cuz they’re kinda useful but like it’s annoying to try and click on a button to find a photo of an anime girl getting beat from behind!!! please fix this!!","userName":"IG-galaxy_doodles32","title":"Highly Disappointed tew many hentai ads💔","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:09:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178078183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the trump 2020 app in order to get updates about the country and more about what’s going on, but I have to say i’m rather disappointed. It’s super difficult to figure out how to work the app and much more disorganized than what I expected from the President. Therefore, I don’t like this app and I think it’s completely faulty","userName":"Clfksixeiwwogfjddjs","title":"Too disorganized","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:09:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178051695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took about 4.20 hours to download. sit nearly drained my battery while i was on my way home. then my phone died and as if that wasn’t bad enough, and bright orange man jumped out of the bushes. i don’t know how he knew my location, but i knew exactly who this was. the app may share your location ( i learned the hard way). after telling him that if he left me alone i would buy him a diet coke, the orange man went away. anyways, the app itself is so hard to navigate. imagine spending lots of money and time on app that has so many issues. couldn’t be me...","userName":"Goldennjayy","title":"technical difficulties everywhere","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:00:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178049504","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app wouldn’t load, it is cheaply made, and is full of bias information. Nothing accurate or interesting. I downloaded this app with the intention that it would educate me on his views and opinions when it is really just a terrible app with completely bias information and it was very boring as well. Absolutely nothing accurate or interesting","userName":"lil.coffee.cake (tiktok💖)","title":"Terrible app✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:00:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178004011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got the app to keep updates, my phone crashes all the time ever since I downloaded it and my apps start to disappear.

I was told that by downloading this app, I would be able to see a bunch of updates and stuff regarding his 2020 campaign. I’ve tried to open the app several times and every time it crashes. I don’t understand how the president of the unites states does not even have a functioning app. In conclusion, all I have to say is “no❤️”.","userName":"TrumoLover69","title":"Trash","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:44:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177999574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened this application, the cis people force fed me Taco Bell, and when I went to use the bathroom, it exploded thanks to you! They also told me they supported Trump and did it for him. I do NOT reccommend getting this app, as it will leak your information such as location, IP, and personal name and age, as well as sex. That is more than likely the causation of what happened.","userName":"Manic P!ATD","title":"I Just Got Explosive Diarrhea","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:43:54Z","isEdited":false}}]}
