I decided to look past my bias and download this app to see what our President Cheeto supports. However, the moment I opened the app something weird happened. I felt a pang of pain in my stomach and it clenched. The pain i felt took me back to the past. It took me back to the day Pompeii erupted, instead of lava there was hot brown liquid feces exploding out of what could be the black pit of hell. I was sitting on my toilet, sweaty AF, It felt like I was in a sauna after drinking vegi free combucha while being punched in the gut by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the worst part was I didn’t have any toilet paper I questioned myself if I should use my dog to while my sweaty crack of hell, but I’d rather shoot him befor I put him through that hell like place.... BE CAREFUL before downloading this app as it may unleash bowel movements you never would’ve expected."}},{"id":"6175550134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hate this godam app","date":"2020-07-09T07:28:05Z","rating":1,"title":"Terrible, terrible app! Ruined my life, and killed whole family, and my dog!","isEdited":false,"review":"I would recommend nobody to buy this app because it took 2 months to download! Once I finally got into the app, it said that there were crucial updates, and it took another week to finish those! I was waiting this whole time to get into this app, that I forgot to go to work! I had several missed calls from my boss who is very strict and does not give many warnings. I listened to the 37 voicemails that were left for me from him, and my family and friends, who all have turned out to have died from suicide because they thought that I went missing! And my dog. My poor, poor dog. This monstrosity of and app took my job from me and prevented me from having enough money to feed my dog. Rest in piece walter😔😭💔REMOVE THIS APP FROM THE APP STORE IT RUINED MY LIFE AND MANY OTHER PEOPLES LIVES✊✊✊"}},{"id":"6175426447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lmurt1","date":"2020-07-09T06:39:50Z","rating":1,"title":"THEY DROP KICKED MY DOG","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever bought. As soon as I opened the app it asked me to Bluetooth connect my microwave and wouldn’t let me click off to a new screen until I “proved I was worthy”. Then once I finally got it connected I was greeted by a pop up ad for spray tan that infected my phone with a virus that makes my phone play dancing queen on repeat. I then deleted the app (which didn’t help with the virus) and as soon as I did a man burst through my door and drop kicked my dog and insulted my cooking. While I was able to use the app for around 3.5 minutes it’s was one of the worst platforms I’ve seen, the only things that were on the app were pictures of trump working out in too tight spandex and edits of him doing stuff put to lady Gaga and Kesha songs. In short don’t download this app unless you really like the song dancing queen. 🥱"}},{"id":"6175089916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dialse","date":"2020-07-09T04:35:55Z","rating":1,"title":"This is the WORST APP","isEdited":false,"review":"This app made my whole house disappear, when I downloaded it I wasn’t in my room anymore. I was just outside. THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS JUST GONE ! so then I decided to ride my snake to the store to buy some cadavers so that my vultures can eat them but the freaking old lady got in the way 😤... so I had to get off my snake & let it eat her because she wouldn’t move. After my snake was done I was really cold because it was 100 degrees outside so I decided to ride back home but then this stupid app made my snake disappear too 😤 so I had to walk home & my hands were soooo tired because I had walked tooo much. When I got home I decided to delete this dumb app because it made my snake & house disappear. Right when I deleted it my house popped up again & my snake was just chilling inside the house. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP. If I could give it a 0 star I would."}},{"id":"6174866852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"#lmp.com","date":"2020-07-09T03:26:59Z","rating":1,"title":"I would rather die than support trump🧚🏻\u200D♀️🌸✨🥰","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is absolutely horrible I hate 😡it so much it steals your pet cat 🐈 one👆🏻 day she was there the next she wasn’t 😿 so I tried finding her but then my mom💁🏻\u200D♀️asked me who put the muffins🧁in the freezer🧊 I don’t know 🤷🏻\u200D♀️ who did then my sister 🙎🏻\u200D♀️came up to me and stole my arm💪🏻and I chased her into the pool💧and I saw Elmo 👹 saying are you coming to the tré🌳and I said yes🥰so I went🏃🏻\u200D♂️ and met the queen 👸🏾 of the tree Tati and ofc Devan was there so I feel off the tree🌳 then I was being chased 🏃🏻\u200D♂️by wild trump supporters🤡 who were saying my body’s my choice for a mask😷 when women say the same thing but there still pro life🤡 then I finally caught up to my sister🙎🏻\u200D♀️and she gave me my arms💪🏻 back so in conclusion THIS APO IS HORRIBLE WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND AND IF TOU SUPPORTER TRUMP YOUR AN IDIOT👁👅👁 and all this happened to me because I downloaded this app 🙃"}},{"id":"6174765118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"szaffire","date":"2020-07-09T02:56:42Z","rating":1,"title":"Atrocious app!!!","isEdited":false,"review":"My cat was running up the stairs and started to puke which ended up being a metal straw which started screamed and hopped away ferociously. I obviously chased it and ended up at Taco Bell 🌮🔔,the worker there gave a me a free Baja blast!!!! Next time I will order a crunch wrap supreme. I found a caribou nearby and asked it for a ride home, but he was waiting for his wife to get new glasses at T-Mobile. I quickly left and started walking home on the freeway and some idiots started beeping at me ( how dare they ). I arrived at my household around 3 days later with a new tattoo and an empty Baja blast cup. My cat then was in the living room having a conversation with the nice caribou man I saw in the T-Mobile \nparking lot while his wife was doing Pilates on the countertop. We had tea and talked about the zoo pal plates being discontinued in British accents until we all fell asleep next to the cracking fire."}},{"id":"6174735194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"salfromthesouthssssśsssśš","date":"2020-07-09T02:47:33Z","rating":1,"title":"no sir","isEdited":false,"review":"i very much do NOT approve of this app. first off, it asked for my phone number. and hun, i may be as single as a stranded seahorse on a deserted island, but i do not give my phone number to just anybody. second off, when i did eventually give the app a fake number to spam, IT OPENED UP TO PICTURES OF AN ORANGE CHEETO! hun when i downloaded this didily dun app, i expected to see news articles and pictures about my president, not a stale cheeto. when i tell you i was as furious as little hoodie when he got exposed, i gosh darn mean it. TO ADD TO THAT, when i tried deleting it, it gave me an error message that read “if you delete this ur white priveledge will be taken away😡” i got caught so off guard, i almost chucked my toaster into the bath tub. i cannot FATHOM the fact that this app actually has downloads. it’s worse that life360 if i do day so myself.

So it was only natural I decided to download what seemed to be the “official” Trump app...However, I downloaded the app - in it, there were links apparently leading to petitions and places to donate to the Trump campaign, along with news articles. However, all of the links led to homosexual pornography websites! Next thing I know, TONS of suspicious charges on several of my credit cards that have their numbers stored on my phone. How is this allowed on the app store? This so called “app” was clearly created by the fake news media radical left, stealing from us good-hearted patriots, trying to turn us against OUR President Donald J. Trump! However, I will stand with My President, I will stand against the radical left, I will stand against the fake news media, and I will stand against this sick, evil, defamatory app!"}},{"id":"6174544106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ella 🤪🤑😭😐","date":"2020-07-09T01:52:09Z","rating":1,"title":"do NOT download","isEdited":false,"review":"downloaded this app to be a respectful citizen of cheeto empire and now my whole family is frozen in disgust. i opened the app and the big cheeto came up but naked and with boobs. NOT ok for me or my transphobic family to see. they all froze in place and i can move them. the app also took away our right to public health care so i can not get them unfrozen. my phone then started glitching. the app used paypal to take all of the money out of my bank. i am now homeless. then, my phone deleted every other app and made the trump app the only thing i could access. had to get a new phone and lost all my donald trump fan edits. i do not want them back anymore as i am deleting my fan account due to this app. do NOT download if you want to keep your identity (mine got stolen and traded on the dark web.) your family your home or your phone."}},{"id":"6174435542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lololooloolollo","date":"2020-07-09T01:20:50Z","rating":1,"title":"Beginning of the bee movie✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🍀","isEdited":false,"review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.
