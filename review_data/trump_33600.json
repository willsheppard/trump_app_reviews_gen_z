It took way to long to download and I saw an orange man who acted like a child! I had my pet rat out and I once I opened the app my rat DIED. It then proceeded to lag and started to play speeches.

Here’s why. First of all, I don’t support Trump, and only got this to see what all of his irrelevant supporters said about him.
