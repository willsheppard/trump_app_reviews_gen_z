By then my parent deemed my mother told me I spend to much time on my phone and took it away all because I was waiting for this dumb app to download. After that I’m became depressed and I didn’t want to do anything I forgot to feed my dog and he passed away. Then the app kept on crashing my phone because it was too stinky.","userName":"a sad civillian","date":"2020-07-08T17:06:08Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible absolutely horrible 💀👁👄👁","rating":1}},{"id":"6173006469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Please read to the very end! :)\n\nWhen I discovered this app, I was quite happy. However, after downloading it, it glitched extremely bad. It wouldn’t work. I’ve never left a negative review before on the app store, but this had to be shared.\n\nI was happy to download this because I wanted to see what our lovely President had to say and I wanted to get some r e a l news. \n\nMy phone was acting strange after the initial crash occurred. I wish I could give this zero stars.\n\nI’m disappointed. \n\nI’m not lying when I said the glitch is terrible, but I was lying about our President being lovely. The orange needs to go, but I was curious as to what his app has. My dear friend TIK recommended this application to me.\n\n                                         - TOK","userName":"- Tik & Tok","date":"2020-07-08T17:03:13Z","isEdited":false,"title":"PLEASE BE CAREFUL!","rating":1}},{"id":"6173006006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is possibly the worst app made in App Store. It took for ever to download and glitches every time I go on it. It had poor graphics and I don’t recommend this app at all. I had to delete it because it was randomly deleting other apps on my phone and is really annoying to have to keep. I also recently found out that it was stealing my info which was rlly scary.I don’t recommend at all :)","userName":"daddysmerf","date":"2020-07-08T17:03:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I Don’t recommend","rating":1}},{"id":"6172785630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to become more informed about President Trump’s campaign, but after reviewing it, I’ve realized how biased it is. It completely alters the perspective of what’s actually going on in this country, and although I hate to say this, bears an uncanny resemblance to filtered communist news! Only the news he wants to be seen is shown. This app isn't a credible source for unfiltered, unbiased news. It’s claiming to be, and it shouldn’t be allowed on the app store.","userName":"Perfect😜doughnut","date":"2020-07-08T15:56:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download","rating":1}},{"id":"6172684998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app literally made my phone glitch so bad where I had to delete the app and re-download it.\nIn the Lily brought a rats to my phone!!!!! And I am terrified of rats. Also it kicked me out the app about five times. And also I didn’t even know until I read some reviews that we can get points and rewards because I never got any awards or anything because this app is bad. DO NOT DOWNLOAD I repeat  DO NOT DOWNLOAD this app it will mess up your device.","userName":"busheisg djdud dijdjdhd","date":"2020-07-08T15:27:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6172647814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a poc and as a women I think having Donald Trump would be a mistake I mean he has the maturity of a 10-year-old he looks like he’s about to drop dead any moment he’s a racist, a R@pist , and has no respect for women do you guys really want that as your president I think he got to go and he also look like a Cheeto which is not the move. Also he has said that he was attracted to his 13-year-old daughter and I think we should send some up for his son.","userName":"Maygodblessamerica","date":"2020-07-08T15:17:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Gotta go","rating":1}},{"id":"6172642365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the WORST app on the App Store! As a person who has downloaded and used many apps this is by far the worst. It took weeks to download, glitches every time I try to open the app. This app KILLED my cat. My cat was just laying in my lap when I tried to open the app an orange face popped up and my cat was terrified she started to shake and and she had a heart attack. I will never vote for someone who makes an app like this. I DO NOT recommend the app!!!","userName":"❄️Snowflake❄️🌬🌨","date":"2020-07-08T15:15:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This is horrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6172607640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app keeps glitching and it has the worst stuff if I put something to watch it will stop working saying something like my WiFi is bad when I put another app my WiFi is fine it’s just this app that doesn’t want to work at all😡😡😡 it makes me mad that I can’t see anything even if I reset my phone which means that the problem is not my phone but this app, don’t get the app it doesn’t work!!!","userName":"……/:","date":"2020-07-08T15:06:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!!!! 😡😡😡","rating":1}},{"id":"6172577287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to stay informed of the world around us and news involving our leader. However, it was to my complete surprise that when i clicked a certain tab, it encouraged me to ✨join them✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️ of course the meaning of this message isn’t quite clear, so i continued. Not long after, i come to the realization that they want me to join their cult in heavily religious beliefs of ignorant and oppressive action. Who would pass that up??🤩🙈","userName":"Tay_mayyy","date":"2020-07-08T14:57:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS PART OF A CULT SCHEME","rating":1}}]}
