wanted to download this app because I was sick and tired of having fake mainstream media give me fake news left and right! I felt like I could no longer trust anyone, not even my own family, with news and updates. So I gave this app a try and 😱😱😱 the horror that I came across. I could not believe it! This app tries feeding me EVEN MORE LIES than I already came across on YouTube, Facebook, and twitter. Everywhere I look is lies! I don’t have anyone left to trust, my husband left me, my children don’t talk to me, my mother and father won’t even look at my face anymore. I felt so blind sighted and thought this app would be my saving grace, but I guess I’m going to have to cut out all news sources altogether. I vow to live out in the country away from everyone and never speak to another soul again. Can’t trust nobody.","rating":1}},{"id":"6175038659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:19:56Z","userName":"rachelrenteria","title":"I hate it","review":"This is the WORST app I ever download.I don’t recommend you downloading this app,however I do recommend you leaving a bad review that will help us all out!!I don’t ever want to see this on the AppStore ever again.Thank you for your time and make sure to NOT vote for a Trump;)","rating":1}},{"id":"6175037715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:19:36Z","userName":"YoBoiF*ckTrump","title":"Trash","review":"He is a perv n he is racist n he a b*tch so ye😇","rating":1}},{"id":"6175037364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:19:29Z","userName":"ᵂᴹᴹᴬ","title":"This app is disgusting❤️❤️👁👅👁","review":"First off when I open the app I see a horrid picture of A wrinkly chetoo.then you see a picture of Barron trump eating that chetoo like  wth i showed my mom and she had a stroke them I showed my dad and he fainted he is still unconscious!?!?!luckly I was wearing my protective goggles when I saw the photo","rating":1}},{"id":"6175036171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:19:08Z","userName":"ex437bfkksb","title":"terrible","review":"Movin' to the country,\nGonna eat a lot of peaches\nMovin' to the country,\nGonna eat me a lot of peaches\nMovin' to the country,\nGonna eat a lot of peaches\nMovin' to the country,\nGonna eat a lot of peaches\nPeaches come from a can,\nThey were put there by a man\nIn a factory downtown\nIf I had my little way,\nI'd eat peaches every day\nSun-soakin' bulges in the shade\nMovin' to the country,\nGonna eat a lot of peaches\nMovin' to the country,\nGonna eat me a lot of peaches\nMovin' to the country,\nGonna eat a lot of peaches\nMovin' to the country,\nGonna eat a lot of peaches","rating":1}},{"id":"6175036076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:19:06Z","userName":"trump is a dumb","title":"This app does not work just like him","review":"He is poop head","rating":1}}]}
