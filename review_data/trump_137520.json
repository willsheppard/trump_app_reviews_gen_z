But when I got this app it kept asking me to vote for the weird old orange man. So I googled him and the only thing that came up was someone called “bunker boy” and this strange picture of a shrimp... I don’t know how this is supposed to keep my clown fish company but I thought it might work because they looked alike. So the next day when I got home my clown fish drowned. I am so incredibly sad right now. This app has ruined my life. I would give this app a zero star rating if I could."}},{"id":"6179903822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Kjg9508","isEdited":false,"title":"Advice???","date":"2020-07-10T07:17:24Z","review":"I downloaded this app and now my phone has started to overheat???

Which is a major problem because nowadays I work a lot off of my phone. I installed the app so I can see both side of the political spectrum.

Trump doesn’t realize what TikTok is to us. It might seem like it’s just an app that kids get addicted too but it isn’t! TikTok has made us laugh in quarantine it helped get me through divorce. It’s a way for us to express our feelings! On TikTok we talk about BLM and about how we think our president is racist. I’m sorry but if Trump is mad that we are disagreeing which his ideas then he is violating my freedom of speech!"}},{"id":"6179902362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"this is Maddy","isEdited":false,"title":"Mr. Goldfish WAS NOT the snack that smiled back","date":"2020-07-10T07:16:51Z","review":"I downloaded this app because I was curious on what the stanky fishy goldfish had to say about the BLM movement.. but when I downloaded it my wallpaper and everything turned orange! I would say I was shocked but that would be a lie 😔 and I don’t LIE LIKE THE GOLDFISH DOES! He claims “✨ I don’t have a racist bone in my body 😃” smh... what I liar! Anyway I went to eat my ramen from the kitchen and you won’t believe what I saw! Everything I touched... it- it turned orange! I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone because of the bullsh*t info it gives and because of the orange touch 😢... requires serious updates including handing it over to Kanye West the hopefully new OWNER AND CEO! #MrGoldfish #Kanye2020 #DontDownloadThisApp"}}]}
