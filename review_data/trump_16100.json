Asked for way too much info, and all for nothing, completely useless. I can’t even share posts about Trump to my fellow republicans. Needs a whole new update, otherwise just get rid of it."}},{"id":"6171910031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:49:52Z","rating":1,"title":"Reasons","userName":"jdjxbcjd x","review":"I just downloaded the app to rate it one star because trump is trying to ban my only social modes called tiktok and I don’t think it’s fair because those are people’s only social media’s too also I think the only reason he wants to ban it is because us gen z’s want to free his son and wife and he is saying it’s to keep y’all safe make sure you take care of your country not a app also MEXICAN LIVES MATTER"}},{"id":"6171626122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T10:15:47Z","rating":1,"title":"Trying to find reasons to vote for POTUS","userName":"Tacobella333","review":"From everything going on in the world...the way COVID-19 was handled, him supporting the confederate flag. Trump removed trans people from the military and tried to make it so LGBT+ can’t adopt from Christian adoption agencies. His lack of support for BLM. Trump’s tweets about the Central Park 5. Mike Pence. Friendship with Epstein. These are just a few reasons off the top of my head. \n\nAlso this app was horrible, not user friendly and I don’t like the logo."}}]}
