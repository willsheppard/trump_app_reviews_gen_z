I would think the a PRESIDENT would have a way better format for his app. I guess daddys money couldnt buy a better format😢 other than that ALL the news is so biased, like bro not everything is about you and against you🤣 anyways this app is horrid but what did i expect from a orange cheetoh🥺 BYE!!! 𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣","title":"HORRIBLE","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:02:06Z"}},{"id":"6173528290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"mexicanmulan","review":"As a proud American and supporter of Donald Duck I decided to download this app.😇🥳😇 This app took so long to download, I fell into a coma and when I woke up, it still wasn’t done downloading.😨😱😨 Anyhow, when I finally had the app, as soon as I opened it my phone started to horrendously glitch and what looked like the fat orange kept appearing on my screen.😳🤔😳 This led to me having a seizure! 🤬😡🤬I’m typing this now in my hospital bed and all I have to say is DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.💯🤬💯","title":"This APP Almost killed me 😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:55:48Z"}},{"id":"6173521899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Zugggg","review":"I was told to download this app for my bible study group, but I soon realized that this is nothing related to that! This app is horrendous! The second I opened it, I was greeted with a picture of a orange-headed, Cheeto puff-looking demon from the 9th circle of hell. My kids use this app as well, I can’t believe they are being exposed to content like this at such a young age. Now, both of my kids suffer from third degree burns and extreme PTSD and stress due to this app. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! 😡😡🤬🤬🤬","title":"Absolutely Horrible App! 🤢🤢🤢","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:53:31Z"}},{"id":"6173516432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Izabella 🤪🤪","review":"I’m not quite sure what’s wrong with the app, but it took such a long time to load. My wifi’s and data works perfectly fine with all my other apps, so I didn’t understand the problem.\n\nThat’s not the only issue that I have though. Once it actually downloaded, it took me to this page with a very large orange wearing a toupee. First off, that’s very disrespectful, our president is not a orange, he’s the proud owner of the Cheetos puff factory and I find it revolting that you got the skin tone wrong.\n\nI really do hope that you all can fix this app, actually, just delete it as a whole. I have already placed an order for my trump rally tickets, so I hope that will be much better.\n\nxoxo- gen z🥰✨","title":"It keeps glitching...","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:51:37Z"}},{"id":"6173497181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"lexirapz","review":"I’m gonna keep my review simple. This app is disgusting. I opened it to find pictures of an overcooked orange. They were so disturbing that they caused emotional trauma. After that I washed my eyes out with bleach. Then a swat team came to my house and sprayed coronavirus all over it. Don’t worry, because I bleached my eyes there was chemicals in my body to immediately fight off the virus. The worst part was when I saw pictures of the orange. I hope you’re happy.","title":"Worst app ever created","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:45:04Z"}},{"id":"6173471208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"ParkerPiratePants","review":"This app is weird!! I think there is something wrong with the coloring because the weird man on the app looks orange!!! There is also a bunch of racist and misogynistic content!  Not very wholesome. It also took forever to down load and now my phone keeps over heating and my blood pressure keeps accelerating. I’m going to have to uninstall it! If you want a better app you should go download TikTok! It has a bunch of great content!!","title":"Somethings wrong","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:36:09Z"}},{"id":"6173464620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lyss Cummins","review":"So basically I downloaded the app because I love Cheetos and really would love to see a Cheeto be president again because that would be like so cool. 😛anyways, once I downloaded it it gave me a virus and now every time my phone turns on there’s a nxked photo of trump and it’s keeps sending me messages from anonymous numbers saying that trump wants to be my sugar daddy... it low key kind scared me 🙈so after I write this review I’m gonna throw away my phone. 🙂","title":"Made me cry","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:33:51Z"}},{"id":"6173449333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"shdjndzh shzndndix","review":"this app almost killed me!
