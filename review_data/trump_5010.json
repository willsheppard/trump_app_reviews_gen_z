This app is terrible!!! It so bad I think the trump team won’t be able to fix the glitches and they should delete it! I don’t want what happened to me to the rest of the users! WARNING DO NOT DOWNLOAD APP! YOUR PHONE WILL GET GLITCHES! I try to disable notifications but they still sent me alerts! I HAD TO GO TO THE STORE TO GET NEW PHONE BECAUSE OF THIS!!! All I wanted was to get updates for TRUMP 2020 election but sadly I got glitches and a poorly organized app! I would strongly advise trump supporters to not risk to cost of getting this app!\n\n-Karan"}},{"id":"6174892057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:18Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"stan twice😻😩🥰✨","userName":"chkn_nuggs","review":"TWICE!\nWhat is love?\n\n매일같이 영화 속에서나\n책 속에서나 드라마 속에서\n사랑을 느껴\nUm 사랑을 배워\n내 일처럼 자꾸 가슴이 뛰어\n두근두근거려 설레임에 부풀어 올라\nUm 궁금해서 미칠 것만 같아\n\nOoh 언젠간 내게도\n이런 일이 실제로 일어날까\n그게 언제쯤일까? 어떤 사람일까?\n\nI wanna know 사탕처럼 달콤하다는데\nI wanna know 하늘을 나는 것 같다는데\nI wanna know know know know\nWhat is love?\n사랑이 어떤 느낌인지\nI wanna know 하루 종일 웃고 있다는데\nI wanna know 세상이 다 아름답다는데\nI wanna know know know know\nWhat is love?\n언젠간 나에게도 사랑이 올까\n\n지금 이런 상상만으로도\n떠올려만 봐도\n가슴이 터질 것 같은데\nUm 이렇게 좋은데\n만일 언젠가 진짜로 내게\n사랑이 올 때 난 울어버릴지도 몰라\nUm 정말 궁금해 미칠 것만 같아\n\nOoh 언젠간 내게도\n이런 일이 실제로 일어날까\n그게 언제쯤일까? 어떤 사람일까?\n\nI wanna know 사탕처럼 달콤하다는데\nI wanna know 하늘을 나는 것 같다는데\nI wanna know know know know\nWhat is love?\n사랑이 어떤 느낌인지\nI wanna know 하루 종일 웃고 있다는데\nI wanna know 세상이 다 아름답다는데\nI wanna know know know know\nWhat is love?\n언젠간 나에게도 사랑이 올까\n\n지금 세상 어느 곳에 살고 있는지\n도대체 언제쯤 나와 만나게 될는지\n언제 어떻게 우리의 인연은\n시작될는지 모르지만 느낌이 어쩐지\n진짜 좋을 것 같아 왠지\n영화 드라마보다도 더 멋진\n사랑이 올 거야 내 예감 언제나 맞지\n어서 나타나봐\n나는 다 준비가 됐지 ready\n\n(어디 있을까) 찾아낼 거야\n(어디 있을까) 보고 싶어 죽겠어\n더 이상 참을 수 없을 것만 같아\n\n사탕처럼 달콤하다는데\n하늘을 나는 것 같다는데\nI wanna know know know know\nWhat is love?\n사랑이 어떤 느낌인지\n하루 종일 웃고 있다는데\n세상이 다 아름답다는데\nI wanna know know know know\nWhat is love?\n언젠간 나에게도 사랑이 올까\n\nI wanna know\nI wanna know\nI wanna know know know know\nWhat is love?\nI wanna know I wanna know\nI wanna know\nI wanna know\nI wanna know know know know\nWhat is love?\nI wanna know"}},{"id":"6174830329","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:16:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"HACKED do NOT use","userName":"Genericuser035","review":"I was excited to find this app since I heard from some friends that it was helpful on ways to support our president in the upcoming Election. I was however sincerely dissapointed. The app became a complete mess after I finished making my profile. It gave me notifications on his tweets and events nonstop. Some of them weren’t even real?? I couldn’t keep up. To me it looks like someone has hacked into his app to discourage voters!! Now they have so much of my information from my profile! I’m worried on how the hackers will attack me next. To my fellow trumpets, we can succeed but not with this app. Keep on fighting🇺🇸🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6174836754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:18:06Z","rating":4,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app with viruses","userName":"f*cc.trump.2020","review":"I downloaded the app and had used it but one day everything started to show up in Russian, there was one particular Russian statement that stood out, I put it in a translator which then said “ we hacked you, just like we hack everything else for trump”. I was shocked and immediately deleted the app, my phone then notified me my phone had a virus. I suggest NOT DOWNLOADING this app. I have also stopped supporting trump and became a democrat.     👁👅👁"}},{"id":"6174808690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:09:52Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible, might have to sue","userName":"🦟🦕🦔🦥🦡🦧","review":"At first I love the app. So useful and it really made me feel more connected to the MAGA fan base. However, after about 2hr of having it, my phone randomly started playing Cardi B. The music was so traumatizing and made my ears start bleeding, like literal blood dripping out my ears, then my dog started to cry and ran away to get away from that trash music. I legit smashed my phone with a mallet for it to stop.  My mom started freaking out and I had to go to the hospital. Not only did this app allow for my phone to be hacked, my parents have outrages medical bill and a new phone to pay for. Don’t get the app. 🐿"}},{"id":"6174790292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:04:24Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Trump 2020 out of the office","userName":"trump is igky","review":"Horrible President.

The only apps I can visit are messages to receive the messages the app sends me, App Store, but I can’t visit anything other than this page, or the app itself!! It drained my battery in 1 minute if I go anywhere else! I’ve tried to get Apple to do it but they said there is nothing they can do. It has taken over my fridge screen as well, all the TVs in my house, and all other electronics. It’s stared spreading to friends technology and family as well. I wish I could delete it. Do not get this app at all unless you wish to be forever haunted by the trump 2020 app."}},{"id":"6174676771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:30:04Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I HATE THIS APP","userName":"Kylie Ross","review":"We already know that Donald Trump is a piece of crap but now he is trying to silence generation z by deleting our only platform to speak out about our opinions on. A decent human being wouldn't be a baby and a poor sport about it but they would actually be happy that we are using our resources to speak out, and instead of trying to shut us up, they would try and see our needs and understand how we see you and try to change that. But no we already know that your a piece of crap who only cares about the lives of rich white men.
