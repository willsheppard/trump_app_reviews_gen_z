And when I downloaded it, my pet corn flew away all by itself. So I took my shrimps to target to get some vegetables to help find my pet corn (I never found it) and my shrimps died. So I went to moe’s to get some tacos and their ice cream machine was broken. I decided after all of that I’d just delete this app. Thank you for your time."}},{"id":"6174653195","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"blushuu","date":"2020-07-09T02:23:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I hate this app","review":"Functionality is horrible, no sign of intelligent life forms to be found. This app made all my plants die in two days and is the reason I wake up with existential dread every single day. I would not recommend this to anybody. Those who live in ignorance live in bliss and make everyone else want to not live, all of a sudden I was racist after downloading this app."}},{"id":"6174547867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"JMHsomeone","date":"2020-07-09T01:53:17Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP","review":"Please don’t get it! This is just the absolute worst and i’m not just saying that! i mean it, first of all, it was just terrible to use, second of all it glitches so so so much like to the point where i want to break my phone it’s that annoying. Last but not least, it will just randomly have a white screen, and boot me out. this is the worst app ever."}},{"id":"6174547155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Shauna 😜","date":"2020-07-09T01:53:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely terrible !!!","review":"Worst app to have ever been made!!! Would not load and every time I would open the app it would automatically force close!! Whenever I could actually get it open it would freeze so I could not actually use the app. Can’t believe apple endorses such bad apps! Would absolutely never download or use again!!!"}},{"id":"6174534890","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nuggetsrreallygood","date":"2020-07-09T01:49:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"What da heck 👁👄👁","review":"I was enjoying this until I saw a picture with the orange man, I need time to process what this man dingle berry is so microscopic , sir are u eating healthy ?
