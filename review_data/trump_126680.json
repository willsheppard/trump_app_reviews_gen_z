I have an app to make sure any of my apps aren’t tracking me and shows me if they are sending any info to people in different countries specifically. THIS APP IS SENDING ALL INFO TO RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA AKA TRUMPS BFFS. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP OR ELSE YOU ARE GIVING ALL YOUR INFO TO OTHER COUNTRIES. \n\nP.S. take away tik tok from us and we’re still bouta find ways to come for your gross orange ass trump"}},{"id":"6178151130","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Traumatizing","date":"2020-07-09T20:34:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dominican lives matter","review":"I downloaded the app thinking I would get a better mindset on our current 🍊president🍊.It did not get better the app gave my phone a virus that cost $400 to fix which I expect the founders of the app to repay me.After no being able to use my phone for a week I decided to give the app a second chance the app gave me a brain tumor the size of a tennis ball since doctor shepherd died in a accident I can not get it fixed I might die.so just don’t download the app"}},{"id":"6178150544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Scam?","date":"2020-07-09T20:33:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Virus L","review":"I’ve never written a review on the App Store before, but my experiences were so terrible that I’ve been forced to share my experiences. Based off of the apps description and name, I was expecting videos from the “annoying orange “ 🍊YouTube series. Instead, I got a faulty app that only displayed the sorry excuse for a President we have today. This man child is not only incapable of holding any political position, he’s incapable of creating an app that works. In fact, much like how this app has been met with STARK criticism, so have his childish actions on Twitter and his constant lies during speeches and interviews. Get out of office. We don’t need an inexperienced and bigoted tyrant with an appalling history of racism, homophobia, and sexism to name a few. Back to this disgusting app, don’t download it. It’s actually just Russian spyware sooo yeah be careful guys. They might hack into your accounts and force you to leave positive reviews on this app (explaining all of the five start views 🤢)... anyways, stay safe out there guys, and fight for what’s right 😤"}},{"id":"6178150255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨beans✨","date":"2020-07-09T20:33:44Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"wh0putthemuffinsinthefreeZer","review":"beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans"}},{"id":"6178150198","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Massive horse cock🦋🥰","date":"2020-07-09T20:33:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"horsecock🦋👄","review":"So I installed this app because I wanted to see mr bunker boys plans for 2020 because Yunno tengerine 2020🤩 and soon everything I saw was just orange and my phone kept crashing, soon enough my room started shifting and now it’s just a tiny little orange.. like how am I supposed to sleep in an orange and then my phone turned into an orange and how am I supposed to explain to my mom that my phone is now an orange and I can’t do anything but eat it. I would not recommend this app unless you are a strong believer and worshiper of oranges because everything that is of use to you will soon become an orange😔"}},{"id":"6178149491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Dumpster Fire 🤢","date":"2020-07-09T20:33:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"M. D. \"not melania shhhh\"","review":"As a fellow patriot and American, I was EXTREMELY excited to download this app. This seemed like the perfect gateway to TRULY make America great again! But after thoroughly investigating this app, it seems as if Mr.Trump’s definition of great equals dumpster fire. Not to mention, when I had opened the app initially, I thought the first image was a jump scare just in case any of those darn liberals wanted to download this app. I almost threw my phone across the room, it scared the bejesus out of me! What appeared was the orange-est and fattest Oompa Loompa I had ever seen in my life. The strange thing was, despite the fatness that surrounds this man, he hand the tiniest, baby hands I had ever seen in my life. Not to mention, I believe a bird left their nest on his head???? This concerning because I fear for the birds life, and I can only hope that it will rightfully rip its nest back to where it belongs. Unfortunately, I cannot make this review any longer, I have therapy in 5 mins for the PTSD that this app has given me. I hope I can recover soon, I don’t know how much more of this dumpster fire I can take. America don’t let this discourage you, but this is the most unpatriotic and anti-American app I have ever came across. Spend your time somewhere else, because this is a waste! Also it breached my data and cause multiple blackouts ALL over my screen. Then it proceeded to tell me to go back to my own country and won’t allow me to reopen the app???? All over trash."}},{"id":"6178149487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Lies","date":"2020-07-09T20:33:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ftuvchh","review":"I got the app because I heard that if you download you get a 💸100000💸check.
