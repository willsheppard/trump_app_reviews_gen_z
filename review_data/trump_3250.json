It really got interesting though when I opened the app and I saw the most terrifying thing possible, it was some little orange man with bright yellow hair. He looked like a carrot, and the worst part? He was running for president! Why would anyone ever vote a carrot for president? That’s when I realized that people are somehow getting brainwashed into voting for this little carrot man, and I thought I must put a stop to this cheetos shenanigans! So please for the sake of his followers to be able to see the light, please let us band together and get this brainwashing app deleted!"}},{"id":"6172482555","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:31:14Z","title":"MY CHILDREN NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL!!!","userName":"IDisnotscience","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app so I could introduce my children to our esteemed President. They’re 4 and 5 years old, but they have to learn early how GREAT Donald trump is 😤. Anyway, I opened the app and it BUGGED OUT!! It started flashing wildly with different colors and crazy shapes, then all of a sudden ghosts, zombies etc. started JUMPING OUT ON THE SCREEN!!!! It scared my kids HALF TO DEATH. When they saw the ghosts they jumped and threw my phone (cracking it). My 4 year old fell and landed on my 5 year old and she CRACKED HER HEAD!! Now she’s in the hospital and I’m waiting to hear some news. I’m absolutely OUTRAGED I can’t believe this app is so terrible. My advice for parents and anyone in general: DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU WANT TO BE SAFE I DON’T KNOW WHAT KIND OF GLITCHES WILL HAPPEN SO IT’S BEST NOT TO EVEN TRY!!"}},{"id":"6172127531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T12:53:41Z","title":"This APP gave me autism!!!!😡😡😡😡","userName":"trumppsmall","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app so i can understand more about our dear bunker boy 🤪and hes support but i looked and everything inside this app was so disgusting, I kept seeing a big fat orange man with a small pp 🍆everywhere. You see this is the first time i saw our dear bunker boy because usually hes in hes bunker, oh and dont get me started on his support it was the most traumatic🥺\nthing i saw on this app they kept saying trump 2020 and 4 more years and i was like who even is trump thats bunker boy anyways I guess everything was just to much for me and I passed out only to wake up and find i now have autism 🤯and LOVE our president😍. So unless you want to be brain dead in order to like our president this app is for u ☺️❤️"}},{"id":"6177708007","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:13:06Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!","userName":"👁👄👁 🧚\u200D♂️💕✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I can’t believe how horrible this app is! I downloaded it in the hopes of educating my narrow-minded self even more about the wonderful Oompa Loompa in chief and all his bigoted, racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic ideas. However, the app took HOURS to download! I could’ve provided an entire football team with an amazing, gourmet meal from McDonalds by the time the app actually downloaded onto my phone! Then it started showing me pictures of the Oompa Loompa himself! The only problem was that the second I saw then, an overwhelming urge to puke overcame me! I’m writing this very review strapped to the side of the golden throne. Overall, I am absolutely disgusted by this app, the people who gave it a five star review, and even Donald Trump himself! C’mon Donny, be best!"}},{"id":"6177577066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:31:27Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Jejehejdjdbddjsjd","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"THIS APP IS ☀️tErRiBlE☀️it took 69 days to download and after it installed on my phone my whole life turned upside down. but id like to take a minute just sit right there, i’ll tell you how i became utterly infuriated with this app😗i got on the app after it took so long to download. as soon as i got on it charged my paypal $420! terrible terrible terrible. i could of spent that hard earned money on something better than this terrible app 😔 as of right now this app keeps sending me notifications about how terrible the app is! it has taken me so long to write this because the app is slowing down my phone and my keyboard keeps disappearing! i expected more from the creators of this app. DO BETTER."}},{"id":"6177535371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:18:16Z","title":"TERRIBLE WORST APP EVERR","userName":"mr_kevOn20","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So when I got the app it needed a mobile phone number which I thought was kinda dumb cause like doesn’t this app just give news about stuff related to trump? And I saw my camera light flashing which I thought was kinda weird so I tried turning it of but it wouldn’t turn off. THEN MY CAMERA WAS ON! I CAN TELL WHEMN MY CAMERA WAS ON AND IT WAS DEFINITELY ON! That’s when I thought are they spying on me?? Then I tried deleting the app but it wouldn’t let ,e which was very crazy! Then it took AN HOUR to delete the app. Crazy!! THEN when I opened up google it showed me a DISTURBING image of a man dressed as a Mickey Mouse but..he was holding something. I don't know what it was but it was VERY DISTURBING! I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS APP CAUSE BAD STUFF CAN HAPPEN TOO YOU!"}},{"id":"6177527938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:15:56Z","title":"wow! what a terrible experience","userName":"ivype","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i was crazy excited to download this app and be bombarded with the daily news! but once i opened the app, i was faced with a picture of a misogynistic, racist, homophobic, transphobic, lying piece of sh!t, so i was obviously very upset, as any american should be. if you were thinking of downloading, please don’t! it also took up abunch of storage on my phone and is also just a terribly designed app overall. i would recommend a less bias news platform to receive your information because this one only gives skewed data and biased reports. terrible app wish i could have chosen 0 stars. anyways A VOTE FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN BIDEN IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP, please remember that when you vote people!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6177467174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:57:27Z","title":"HORRIBLE","userName":"mha.weeb","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Ok so I got this app to support our ✨wonderful✨ President Donald Trump. When I Ope fed the app everything seemed fine but after a few minutes I kept on getting kicked out of the app! I tried turning off my phone and turning it back on but nothing was working :( then eventually my phone started crashing as well. I had seen another review like this which means it’s happening to other people as well! Which is NOT a good thing, I know for a fact it’s not bc of my phone bc my phone is fairly new and has NEVER done this until I downloaded the app. I was NOT happy with this app and it deserves the 1 star ratings it has gotten. I’m now going to go delete the app from my phone. Have a good day"}},{"id":"6177301786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:09:19Z","title":"Even 1 ⭐️ is too high","userName":"Emmandm14","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So I download this app because as an educated human, I have found that I can’t trust scientists, teachers, and health care workers. Instead, the only trustworthy source is a deranged orange reality tv host who clearly has everyone’s best interests at heart (as long as you’re rich, white, male, straight, etc). But then, the app is asking for my phone number! Like, who do you think you are requesting my information like that. I think if you want my actual cell phone number, you should give me yours. It’s only fair. Then I can text you as often as you text me with obnoxious updates about how you need money. I’m a broke college student and you’re a “rich” celebrity. You should be paying me."}},{"id":"6177243289","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:52:21Z","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","userName":"Bea Pre","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"once the app downloaded my phone crashed and all memory from my phone was deleted. I overlooked this and proceeded to look on the app only to have it shut off my phone every time I opened it. I finally realized that due to my parents restrictions on my phones I probably could not open it due to the hate symbols it provides ex) Donald Trump and his racist, sexist views and opinions. His living breathing self exemplifies so many current issues in the US!!! For example taking away human rights!!! I thought all people had the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness but Trump proved me wrong. The only thing the man has been right about. Anyways don’t download the app it’s absolute trash just like Trump!"}}]}
