My eyes fluttered open, though it was blurry. \"I didn't touch her, I swear.\" ... That voice... Obama? I blinked and stared at the m. A security guard was interrogating the group. \"She's awake I see. So, she isn't dead. But I still need answers from you all so I can know what happened.\" \"I just wanted to pee.\" Spoke a man's voice. He had a hat that read 'Jake'. I pulled myself up a little more, surprised to see everybody I had met today. Lizzie was scolding that Nolan kid. She yelled, \"I swear, if you had anything to do with this young lady getting hurt, you won't hear the end of it!\"have not!\" Lizzie's tone was like a mothers. Johnathan, the one with the backyard hat, squirmed over his desk like a baby kitten who's trying to climb something to big for itself.

He looked over to the security guard. \"Carmella, I don't think her actions deserve any severe punishment. And her head looks perfectly fine after falling. The only punishment I see fit for her, is that we keep her here over the night to talk more of her crimes.\" Wait.. + What crimes? T remembered what I had done to the wax sculpture... The red lipstick kisses on it.. Had Obama found it? \"Fine.\" Muttered Carmella. \"As long as she doesn't sleep in our room, we're fine with it.\" Spoke one of the kids that had approached me with Danny Tanner and Nick. The Emo one, Hannah, was the one that spoke. Next, came the smaller one, Heather. \"The bathrooms are ours at night!\"","title":"It keeps glitching","date":"2020-06-05T01:21:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6031409531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"isaac_something","review":"0/10, ran by a terrible person","title":"I love Donald Trump üßö\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ö°Ô∏è but on a gravestone ü•∞üíï","date":"2020-06-03T20:42:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179189206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mar_Monate","review":"Froze my phone !
