So then I was like whatever maybe my iPhone is broken and I just decided to drop the whole thing and ignore when my phone would crash. Well that was a bad mistake. Over the next couple of days my phone was constantly crashing. It didn’t matter if I was on Facebook or if I was on candy crush it was just constantly crashing. Now I know that some of you are thinking “oh your phone is just old “ but my phone had never done that before I got the app. It was constantly and constantly crashing and closing me out of apps I seriously think this app is no good for you and you seriously should not get it. Not to mention the fact that this app also took up a tremendous amount of storage on my phone. Please do not get the app, it’s software must be really out of date and will ruin your phone- not to mention I think it stole my information when it crashed. That being said I wish I could give this app a 0 but unfortunately I cannot. This app is no good!</p>

Over the next couple of days my phone is constantly crashing. It didn’t matter if I was on Facebook or if I was on candy crush, I was just constantly crashing. Oh now I know what some of you may be thinking “oh your phone is just too old” But my phone has never done that before I got the app. It was constantly and constantly crashing and closing me out of apps. I seriously think that this app is no good for you and you seriously should not get it. Not to mention the fact that this app also took up a tremendous amount of storage on my phone. Please do not get the app it’s awful must be really out of date and will ruin your phone. That being said-I wish I could give it up zero but unfortunately I cannot. This app is no good.

But unfortunately the app kept making my cell phone crash . It was constantly kicking me out of the app time and time again . So I thought it was a problem with my phone . So I powered my phone off and waisted a couple of minutes to get back to the app . Then after about ten minutes , I went back onto the app and it continued to crash and kick me out . So then I was like whatever maybe my iPhone 6 is broken and I decided to just drop the whole thing and ignore when my phone would crash . Well that was a big mistake. Over the next couple of days my phone was constantly crashing. It didn't matter if I was on Facebook or if I was on candy crush , it was just constantly crashing. Now I know that some of you maybe thinking “ oh your phone is just old “ but my phone has never done that before I got the app. It was constantly and constantly crashing and closing me out of apps. I seriously think that this app is not good for you and you should seriously not get it. Not to mention the fact that this app also took up a tremendous amount of storage on my phone. That being said - I wish I could give this app a 0 but unfortunately I cannot. This app is no good. Please do not get this app!! Your phone will be ruined once u get it.</p>

I'm not even kidding. I downloaded it because of course I wanted to stay updated on the news and messages from and about America's greatly loved and adored president but when I downloaded, the app wouldn't even open. At first I thought it was some random glitch or something in my phone so I wrote it off but later I tried to open it again and the same thing happened so I un-downloaded it and re-downloaded it. When I opened it for a third time after doing that, all that came up was a black screen that said MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN but in a kinda distorted way which all around was kinda creepy. Then all of the sudden my phone just died which was really weird since it was on the charger. It took about three hours till it turned on again and while I opened it everything seemed fine but I noticed my tiktok app had been un-downloaded and found that my storage had been maxed out, the homepage kept freezing, my max battery life had dropped to 21% which was absolutely crazy because this is a new phone and all my social media accounts had been flooded with pro-trump posts, aesthetic pictures of walls, and a lot of racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic messages on them that I didn't post—it was insane— so I deleted the app and had to eventually get a new phone because it was basically unstable. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP.</p>

<p dir="ltr" data-test-bidi="">so basically i downloaded this app because i wanted to stay informed on the campaign and stuff but as soon as i entered the app it asked for my social security number and my favorite starbucks drink. i don’t even like starbucks smh. when i put in my social security number and address my phone glitches out and jumped out of my hand and fell on the ground. the screen was SHATTERED and i had to get a new phone. i got my new phone and re downloaded the app and after HOURS of downloading it finally opened and make america great again showed up in orange and purple letters but they were out of order so it read “america again great make” and then it disappeared and all i saw was a black screen. i tried to exit the app but every time i hit the home button or the power button or anything really the black screen just stayed there. i thought maybe it died so i plugged it in and 5 hours later my fire alarm went off! my phone had literally exploded. i tried downloading the app a final time on my ipad and as soon as the app was available a huge crack appeared in the glass screen. i went through 2 phones and an ipad trying to get this stupid app to work. And now every time i go on any social media platform all i get is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and xenophobic posts!!! ❤️❤️✨✨please, oh great trumpkin, make a new app ✨❤️🧚‍♂️ so we can bully it again 🧚‍♂️✨🥺</p>
